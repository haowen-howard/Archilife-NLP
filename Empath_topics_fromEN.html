In heightening climate change, Taiwan is relatively safe, compared to some countries where a high-risk environment has brought certain impact. This impact will spillover to affect Taiwan's export, stock market and job opportunities, causing instability in the society. As we face the changes in the external environment, we should consider flexibility and adaptability in terms of developing internally, instead of endless expansion. In this explosive information era, we must acquire knowledge in all domains, so we can develop the ability to conduct research and analysis. We will achieve double effects of we can discuss and make consolidated judgements from different domains. That is why Archilife has established the new \"K2 Special Team\" to investigate the establishment of the livable model Earth 2.0, and is expected lead humanity through the trials.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Li Shu-an gave a speech on \"Strategies for Control of PM2.5 in Taiwan\". The speaker began his speech by introducing PM2.5 as one of the IARC group 1 carcinogens. The micro-granules of PM2.5 adsorb toxic substances, like heavy metals and dioxins, which are known to be possible causes to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory tract conditions and lung conditions. He continued to introduce Taiwan's control standards for PM2.5, how suspended micro-granules are deposited in the lungs and the classification of suspended micro-granules. He said that the main source of PM2.5 in the metropolitan area is exhaust from motor vehicles. Finally, the speaker introduced the strategies for prevention of PM 2.5, including control of exhaust emissions, setting standards and regular monitoring, air-quality packs, development of green transportation and an automatic license plate identification system. Finally, he closed his speech by encouraging the nation to work together for clean air. Next, Mr. Yao Wei-zheng gave a speech on \"Strategies for Preventing Disease Outbreak under Climate Change\". The speaker began his speech from raising the issues that, under the threat of climate change, high temperature environment increases the risks of cardiovascular, respiratory and lung diseases and massive breakouts of infectious diseases, like Dengue Fever. Severe Dengue Fever may result in shock and even death. Dengue Fever is caused by a virus spread through Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus through biting. The symptoms include headache, sore muscles and fever. Dengue Fever is no longer a problem contained to tropical Southeast Asia. Numerous cases have emerged in Taiwan, Europe and the US. The most effective way to prevent this disease and contain the epidemic is to control the breeding of the vector mosquitoes.

The Archilife NT Team has also analyzed how temperature change caused the rise and collapse of civilizations in the East and West from history and geography. Archilife members attending this meeting today are elites of society. Your businesses or ventures will achieve sustainability if you keep altruism and public welfare in mind. Finally, as electronic manufacturing begins to decline, I hope that unique and innovative industries will rise in Taiwan in the future. I believe that Taiwan is moving toward the right direction. Let's work together for a better future.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Lin Chin-yuan gave a speech on \"Eco-Farm Management from the Perspective of Sustainability\". The speaker began his speech from sharing the background and motives of his participation in developing an eco-farm in Saint Christopher and Nevis, analyzed the status of the farm and proposed recommendations for improvement. The speaker pointed out that achieving sustainability is not about migrating a civilized society to another location; it is, in fact, about improving the present place into a more ideal environment through integrating the local resources, to achieve the goal of sustainable development. The speaker suggested that a farm can develop experience-based products, such as eco-recreation, food and agriculture education, with an emphasis on ecology, production and living, as well as adding the concepts of livelihood and life with integrated aesthetics to increase the added-values of the products. Next, Mr. Lin Yu-yi gave a speech on \"Strategies for Revitalizing Farmland-with an example of Changhua Farm\".

At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning itinerary brought everyone to Taiyang Mushroom Farm. As part of the photovoltaic farming project in Linbian, Pingtung, many solar panels are installed within the farm. By hanging a canopy of black mesh under the solar panel mounting rack and using sprinkler system, a suitable space is created for cultivating mushrooms. The guide first led everyone to the mushroom racks under the solar panels to look at the precious and rare deer-antler lingzhi mushroom, and explain its nutrition and economic value. There were also numerous other spawn bags that contain other species of mushrooms with different characteristics. The guide also gave everyone a taste of natural lingzhi tea. The next destination was the nearby Kuangtsai Wetland Smart Energy Demonstration Park. First, everyone had to make pizza for lunch later by kneading the dough and allowing it to ferment. While waiting for the fermentation process to complete, everyone participated in DIY activity of potting aquatic plant. Excess aquatic plants from the park's pond were placed in globe containers to make eco-friendly ornaments. After the DIY activity, everyone had to place ingredients on the lunch pizza and put them in a wood-fired oven to bake. Everyone enjoyed the delicious pizza with Taiyang Mushroom Farm's fresh mushroom soup. After lunch, the guide explained the connection between solar energy and water, and introduced the installation arts and planned facilities in the park, leaving a deep impression in everyone's mind. The afternoon's itinerary brought everyone to Seadawn Seafood Museum, which is Taiwan's first seafood snack museum. Led by the guide, everyone learned about the manufacturing process of seafood snacks and the types of fish often used in seafood snacks. The final leg of the day's itinerary was crab fishing at Crescent Bay, Chifeng. The guide began by distributing materials used for crab fishing and explained how to tie the bait. Then everyone went to the bank area to learn how to throw their baits as far as they can with centrifugal force and the correct angle, and checked their nets for catch after five minutes. At the end of the activity, everyone was treated to duck eggs and sweet potatoes baked in a sand kiln. Everyone had a great time as crab fishing was not a common experience most people had. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end.

At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Nestled in the lush greenery of the mountains, Shuichuan Farm was originally a recreational farm that provides the public a place for recreational and camping activities. However, the infrastructure and business that took years to develop fell apart overnight when severe typhoon swept the area on August 8, 2009. With help from the Kaohsiung City Government, the farm started on the road to recovery, gradually and successfully turning to organic farming. The tour began with the farm owner introducing the farm's free-range chickens, the natural environment where they are raised and the nutritional chicken feed used. He also taught everyone how to tell the quality of chicken by their feathers and crest, compared the difference between time taken to raise chickens used by fast-food chains and that for Shuichuan free-range chickens, and explained the farm's commitment to growing organic, non-toxic fruits and vegetables. During the tour, everyone was able to interact closely with farm animals and even take photos with a chicken in their arms. Lunch was specially prepared with ingredients ranging from rice to vegetables that were grown in the farm. During lunch, the farm owner introduced the special features of their dishes as many of them contained ingredients that were not commonly seen in the city. While simple, the dishes were sumptuous, light and healthy, and everyone had an enjoyable meal. After lunch, the farm owner's son took over as tour guide. Besides introducing unique plant species in the farm, he also pointed out the types of plants that could easily cause confusion and explained how to differentiate them. Furthermore, he brought everyone to the area of the farm remaining from the destruction of the August 8 typhoon. He gave a vivid description of what happened during the disaster, emphasizing the importance of man's symbiotic relationship and coexistence with nature. At the end of the tour, the farm owner performed the art of making traditional Tang Chung (stretched sugar) candy. The art of making this unique traditional snack is officially listed as a traditional folk craft. It has gradually died out because it can only be made by masters with expert skill. As many interns had never seen the making of this traditional snack before, they were intrigued by the amazing skill of transforming white sugar syrup into stretched candy. Its crisp texture and sweet taste also left a deep impression in everyone's mind. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone boarded the bus to Taipei after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The October Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2016 was held on October 23, 2016. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The world has fallen into turmoil recently. In addition to the fierce debate in the US Presidential Election, the pro-China stance of the Philippine's president not only put the international community under tremendous pressure, but may also cause disintegration of the international relations system. Therefore, in this turbulent time, Through the Public Policy Communion, Archilife conveys the policies of the Public Policy Team to educate the members and interns of Archilife and prepare them to make the right decisions for the nation and society. Furthermore, under climate change, serious temperature fluctuations are still occurring in October.

The speaker began from the UN Climate Change Conference two weeks after the terrorist attack in Paris in November 2015. While the world leaders condemned the act of terror, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu raised another point: Why do people fear terrorist attacks, but ignore the disasters brought by extreme climates? The world leaders echoed his claim. The Conference focused on how to control global warming, when the temperature worldwide is raising an average of 1.5\u00b0C, the disasters, indemnity for the damages and the effectiveness of carbon reduction in the past five years. The speaker further shared her experience on-site of the negotiation. She said that the negotiation went on for 24 hours non-stop, so good strategy and physical fitness would be essential to go through the process. Finally, the speaker mentioned that a recent survey shows that 60% of the people in Taiwan have never heard of the Paris Agreement. This shows that sources of information are lacking in this country. She expects more information will become available to the public to raise public awareness on climate change. Next, Mr. Wang Wen-an, spoke on \"Observation on Smart Environments and Smart Living\". The speaker began his presentation from the arrival of the smart digital era and applications in different aspects.

The speaker began from the lifecycle of buildings and the concept of energy-saving and carbon reduction through city renewal. He shared four cases through rich illustrations and photographs. He elaborated that all four cases were planned in a holistic concept, including wide pedestrian walks and green landscapes. Exteriors of the structures are simple without excessive designs to achieve carbon reduction in the process of construction and recessed windows cut down direct sunlight to reduce the load on air conditioning. \"Demolition\" was a significant milestone in the process. Although the buildings are old, each of the house owners had a certain level of attachment to the places. Therefore, the project enforcer documented the process for the house owners as a memorabilia. In conclusion, the speaker pointed out that every successful city renewal case was achieved by compromises between the developer and estate owners. They pushed forward the projects with gratitude to each other. Next, Miss Sun Ruei-suei, spoke on \"Living Water Turns on a City: The Creative City Movement\". The speaker began from the origin of a creative city and provided a definition: A creative city is a spatial model that converges cultural-economic, technological and creative talents. She continued to elaborate on the theories and introduced cases of \"creative city\", including large cities of the \"agglomeration strategy\", such as Hollywood and Bollywood, and small cities, such as the East Village of New York and Covent Garden of London, \"city transformation strategies\", such as Cambridge and South Korea, \"city renewal strategies\", such as Salzburg of Austria, and \"incubation strategies\", such as Silicon Valley and Boston Science Park. Finally, the speaker stressed that creative city is a significant development in the future of human dwelling and she hoped that we can bring better living spaces and quality of living through public participation in the forming of creative cities. Next, Mr. Chen Yuan-hung, spoke on \"Easy Access Facilities\". The speaker began from stating that easy access facilities are not only for users with disabilities, but also for the elderly, the incapacitated and women with children. He added that guiding signs should be installed along outdoor passages and obstructed ground, including obstruction by poorly designed tactile paving, should be avoided to facilitate free movement of wheelchair. Ramps at refuge floors should have continuous railings and obstruction-collision prevention designs that meet the standards of regulatory requirements, and over-steep slopes should be avoided. The speaker pointed out common fallacies in easy access designs, including no ramps for the gap between indoor and outdoor grounds, objects placed in passageways, no fall-protection or warning signs before stairways and poorly-located railings, flush buttons and emergency buttons in washrooms. The speaker presented informative and professional knowledge on easy access facilities with rich photos and case studies and stressed the significance of accurate and safe installation.

Other than the explicit causes, the implicit causes are related to climate change. Therefore, the Archilife NT Team continued to survey and assess the conditions of climate change in the Nation, in search of counter climate change strategies to mitigate the pressure from \"natural selection\". In recent years, Archilife has been actively participating in international conferences to make Taiwan's voices heard in the international society and showcase Taiwan's innovative ideas to the world. We are expecting to push forward our plans in Taiwan after we gain recognition in the world arena. Let's work together for a better future.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chou Yu-ching, a member of the Public Policy Committee, presented a speech on the \"In-Community Home Care Program\". The speaker began with the top 3 health problems in Taiwan - Metabolic Syndromes (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypertension), cancer and aging. He pointed out that the elderly population will double in the next 20 years, and the extremely hot weather brought by climate change will be a direct cause of death associated with cardiovascular and respiratory problems, threatening the health of the elderly. In the past, \"home care\" was seldom a common practice in medium and large medical institutions. As the society ages, the National Health Care system is pushing forward a planned home care system, targeting the elderly who need medical attention and those who have lost the ability for self-care. This is a move to take medical care from clinics to homes. The speaker himself has also signed an MOU with community and regional hospitals to bring comprehensive services to more people in need. Next, Mr. Chou Po-cheng, a member of the Public Policy Committee, spoke on \"Exploration on the Environmental Benefits of the Kaohaus Go Program\". The speaker began with introducing the idea of Kaohaus GO.

Many researchers carried out simulation of environmental effectiveness, including lighting and ventilation, and their studies brought the Construction and Planning Agency to support the Kaohaus GO Program. Empirical results have also proved the benefits brought by this Program to the industries, economy and carbon reduction goals. In the future, the Kaohaus GO 3.0 Program is expected to incorporate the concepts of smart home, disaster prevention and life box into the overall design, aiming to create safe home environment. Next, Mr. Tsai Kun-hsien, a member of the Public Policy Committee, spoke on \"The NTD(neglected tropical diseases) under Climate Change\". The speaker began by pointing out that convenient global transportation has become one of the major causes of the spread of diseases. NTD means \"neglected tropical diseases\". When a disease attacks a country, inevitably, the economy will be affected and recovery will only be possible when the problem is tackled from the source. Tropical diseases affect the health of over 1 billion people worldwide. The speaker used three examples to raise the awareness of the audience: bugs in an unhygienic environment, louses in unhygienic bodies and highly reproductive cockroaches. Finally, the speaker urged us to pay close attention to the changes in the natural ecologies. He stressed that \"prevention\" is the most important action that should be taken to minimize the harms brought by diseases.

For lunch, the proofed dough was shaped, ingredients were added according to individual preference, and the pizzas were baked in a brick oven. The DIY factor made the experience more fun and the pizzas especially delicious. After enjoying the handmade pizzas for lunch, the main attraction of the day's tour began. There was an introduction to common species of crocodiles and ways of identifying them, and specimens were shown so that everyone could learn about the different parts of a crocodile and their economic value. Next, everyone was shown the actual crocodiles and their habitat. The interns experienced the thrill of feeding the crocodiles themselves and felt the strength of the crocodiles' bite when they had a tug-of-war with the crocodiles using a long bamboo pole. In addition to crocodiles, the farm also reared ostriches, chickens and bullfrogs. The farm owner also gave an introduction of their ecology and related knowledge. At the end of the tour, farm personnel showed the interns how to launch water rockets. After a brief explanation of the scientific principle, the water rockets were launched using an air pump. Some of the interns had never played with water rocket before, and were especially curious and thrilled. The entire trip and hands-on experience had been enriching, and the farm owner's enthusiasm and humor made the guided tour even more interesting. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The May Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2016 was held on June 19, 2016. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"From the smile of Archilife members, I can see you must have enough intelligence and knowledge to deal with extreme weather. Archilife also continues its relevant research through different special research teams. Currently, the findings concerning the impact and mitigation/adaptation of climate change by the NT Special Team are encouraging. In the coming half-year, the new-generation Pioneer Team will start an investigation of human ecology and human settlement in the next century. It has been very hot lately. This will affect the physiological health of those who have an adaption problem to temperature change. Please be reminded to adjust your daily life habits. Be \"conservative, conservative, and more conservative\" is the guideline to walk farther and further.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Lin De-en,  presented a speech on the \"One Seed: A Message from Climate Change\". First, he mentioned the usual weather events in Taiwan this year: snow in northern Taiwan in January, record-high temperature in June, and the torrential rain that flooded Taoyuan Airport due to a stationary front in early June. All these are perceivable evidence of climate change: unpredictable temperature change and drought-flood interchange. Then, the speaker introduced two important concepts: (1) the occurrence condition and structural condition of tail turbulence has changed as a result of climate change, and different forms of tail turbulence can increase danger; and (2) the co-movement effect of the urban heat island effect and local circulation strongly suggests a correlation between rising thermal convection in the afternoon and increased conventional rain in volume. Lastly, the speaker suggested that the \"tree effect\" advocated by Archilife could help reduce disasters in the future. Next, Mr. Chang Chen-chung, spoke on \"Revitalization and Regeneration of Cultural Heritage\". First, the speaker mentioned that world heritage registration is an international convention supported by the UN and implemented by UNESCO to preserve natural or cultural properties with outstanding and general value to humankind. Although there are qualified cultural heritage artifacts in Taiwan, we could not sign the convention as we are not a UN member state. We must prepare ourselves and wait for the opportunity. Currently, we plan to join the convention with other member states in the name of a region. Then, the speaker introduced a few examples on the revitalization and reuse of cultural heritage worldwide, such as the Ruhrgebiet in Germany and Jiufeng and Jinguashi in Taiwan. According to him, by introducing suitable activities, we can make profit to maintain and sustain these cultural heritages. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour.

After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"With Archilife's Omni-knowledge cultivation system, members have gradually emerged from respective fields. I hope that the refined speech of members of the Public Policy Committee can help every one of you clearly capture the future direction of national development. In addition, traditional laws and regulations must be changed to keep pace with times in order to cope with social unrest. Lastly, I would remind you to consider climate change in whatever you do and make wise judgement to review your act in order to seek survival, pursue a living, and extend life.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Li Yen-yi, a member of the Public Policy Committee, presented a speech on the \"A Preliminary View on the New Development Trend of Asia Maritime Cities: Hong Kong, Kaohsiung, Shanghai, and Singapore\". First, the speaker shared his recent international conference experience worldwide. In particular, he mentioned the population expansion problem in Singapore's transformation. Then, he talked about the 2015 NTUT+CUHK+SZU+STU held in Kaohsiung where the possibility of \"Self-Sustainable Eco-Village\" in Taiwan was discussed. At the Cross-Strait Urban Old Age Forum held in Shanghai, the potential impact of social, economic, food, and building trans-use problems on urban and rural development was discussed. To trade-oriented Hong Kong, the inrush of population will be the problem. Lastly, the speaker expressed that although the division of land resources has been stabilized, the striving for maritime resources has just begun. Maritime countries should find the development positioning in order to improve competitiveness. Next, Mr. Chen Kai-ling, a member of the Public Policy Committee, spoke on \"Airport MRT Planning and Development Vision\". First, the speaker talked about the characteristics of railway operations, including the exclusive right of way, high personnel expense, large scale, and operational difficulties. Then, he mentioned that the Airport MRT would be exceptionally important to those who would buy their homes outside of the outer counties when estate prices soar, as the line runs across Taipei City, New Taipei City, and Taiyuan City. To transport passengers from and to the airport, the Airport MRT has planned an express line, and the design of the passing loop and overtaking lane should be exceptionally careful. The pre-check-in service will also be planned in the urban area. In terms of operations, quality service, well-planned finance, and expertise are essential. In addition to raising ridership, the development of secondary business is another way to cultivate income sources. In cutting expense, minimizing expense is a way. Lastly, the speaker hoped that the Airport MRT could achieve the goals of system safety and stability, quality service, and sustainable operations. Next, Mr. Lin Yu-yi, a member of the Public Policy Committee, spoke on \"Touching Stories from Earth\". First, he mentioned the devastating scene in southern Taiwan and how indigenous communities were forced to leave their homes after the onslaught of typhoon Morakot seven years ago. In addition to the need of hardware housing equipment, they faced cultural inheritance, family cohesion, and employment problems. Then, the speaker explained the difficulties and construction problems of Freeway NO.5. He also mentioned that engineers would build the freeway with a professional and humble attitude to minimize impacts on the environment and respect nature. According the speaker, the collapse of the Shenzhen Industrial Zone in China in 2015 exposed the importance of construction safety management in urban areas. Lastly, he said that although every country has established SOPs for emergency rescue, regrets for timely rescue often arise as the grey zone in the division of responsibility and authority is huge. He shared these stories to hope for a better future of Taiwan! After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The July Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "The August Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2016 was held on August 14, 2016. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"After the new government took up office, latent problems in society emerged one after another. At this moment of reformation, we hope that the recommendations made by members of our Public Policy Committee can help to promote steady social development. We need to make policies wisely. Therefore, I hope that Archilife members can discover correct decisions and thinking through brain storming from mutual exchange. We keep observing the unexpected situations in everyday life caused by the impact of extreme weather brought by climate change. Also, may I remind you to keep our code of practice: conservative, careful, cautious.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Li Shu-an,  presented a speech on the \"Safety and Health Management of Nanomaterials\". First, the speaker explained that a substance could be called a nanomaterial when all dimensions are below 100 nanometers. We can use nanomaterials in the optoelectronics and semiconductor industries for their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical characteristics. However, scholars found that nanoparticles can penetrate blood vessels, and after they enter the heart and lungs of animals, they can cause pneumonia and lung damage, rise of oxidative stress indicators, vascular occlusion, myocarditis and myocardial degeneration. Therefore, to prevent the hazards of nanomaterials on human beings, relevant authorities have included nanomaterials in the Occupational Health and Safety Act and published the Nanomaterial Safety and Health Technical Manual for workers to understand more about nanomaterials and how to handle them and to reinforce the management of hazardous substances. Next, Miss Yu Hsiu-yun, spoke on \"Literary Research and Climate Change\". First, the speaker talked about a seminar. Studies of phonology, script, unearthed artefacts, and the Y chromosome found that indigenous peoples in Alaska, most part of the northwestern America, may have been a branch of the Huaxia people in Asia, and the research of ancient tribes helped us understand the trend and urgency of climate change. The speaker pointed out that the Tlingit people mentioned in ancient literature was the people from Lingzhi, as mentioned in \"Xiao Kuang\" of Guanzi and Book of Han. The Shuxin was the Sushen tribe as recorded in \"Dahuangdong jing (Classic of the Great Wilderness: East)\" of Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) and in \"Four Barbarian Tribes\" in Book of Jin. Then, the speaker mentioned that the February high temperature in the North Pole was a record high. In July, the grass in Alaska looked like a green carpet. As temperature rise resulted in the slow growth of frigid zone forests, carbon absorption slowed, and climate change expedited. Lastly, the speaker quoted the scenes of droughts and floods in poetry, folk songs, and novels as evidence for climate change research. Next, Mr. Lin Chin-yuan, spoke on \"Discussion of Beautiful Countryside Program and Poverty Alleviation Travel in China: A Cross-Strait Exchange Perspective\". First, the speaker compared and contrasted Taiwan's \"Rural Regeneration Program\" and China's \"Beautiful Countryside Program\" and gave examples from the recent successful cases. In Taiwan, the Zhaomen Agricultural Recreation Area has become one of the top ten classic agricultural and fishery villages. In China, the coastal wetlands greening and beautification project is in Machong Town, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. In Datong City, Shanxi Province, local endemic flora is the focus of rural renewal. The speaker also used the Pingtan Island in Fujian Province as an example. According to him, misconceptions in the construction mode of China's Beautiful Countryside Program often cause irreversible damage to the environment. The speaker added that it is hoped that methods benefiting society and the environment can be used to promote regional industry revitalization and achieve the vision of \"local production for local consumption\" and \"sustainable agriculture\". After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The August Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the tour of August 6, 2016, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 23 ARF interns and their parents on a trip to learn about Huoyanshan ecology in Sanyi and experience rice planting in the Tongxiao Leopard Cat Paddy Field. It was sunny on the day of tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The tour began with a visit to Huoyanshan Forest Ecology Museum and Skywalk in Sanyi Township, Miaoli County. Miaoli's Huoyanshan is the watershed between Taiwan's southern and northern climates. Cut and eroded by the flow of Daan River, it has formed a unique geomorphic landscape.The itinerary began with viewing a film on the formation of the Huoyanshan mountain region, including an introduction of terminology used, and then a documentary film on the repopulation of the leopard cats, followed by the tour guide sharing his years of experience in studying the repopulation of leopard cats. The interesting presentation, enhanced with many vivid photos of difficulties encountered in the leopard cat repopulation, had everyone captivated.  The tour ended with the museum guide explaining the habits and habitat of the leopard cats with the aid of display boards. After leaving the museum, the tour guide also brought everyone to Miaoli's Skywalk to search for traces of leopard cats. Even though the search was futile, everyone enjoyed the splendid scenery of the little town of Tongxiao. Lunch was farmhouse dishes in Fengshu community cooked with locally grown rice, chicken and natural honey. After lunch, the bee farmer explained the social organization and characteristics of bees. Next, the tour guide brought everyone to a mountain in Fengshu community where a camera mounted to a fixed point was placed. Even though the camera did not manage to capture any image of leopard cats, everyone was thrilled to find photos of other animals passing by the camera. Afterwards, the interns also had great fun planting rice, which was something they would normally not have the chance to experience. The tour ended with the tour guide introducing the ecology of leopard cats and history of Fengshu community through a series of photographs. The visual aids helped everyone understand the relationship between leopard cats, locally grown rice and local people, and how this relationship nurtures a friendly environment. Not only was the itinerary and hands-on experience enriching, the tour guide and farm owner's enthusiasm and humor also enliven the activities. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The September Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2016 was held on September 4, 2016.

The agenda of discussion has broadened from ecological settlements to comprehensive life scenarios, in order to seek the constant and invariable absolute truth from the ever-changing world with the expectation to enrich our density of knowledge and continue to explore the future of humanity. In addition, regarding the drastic temperature change resulted from climate changes, Archilife continues its research to seek responding solutions and future directions. Finally, we remind you that WSBE17 Hong Kong will be held in June 2017 and we expect all Archilife members to take part in it and promote the ideas of Archilife globally.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Miss Cheng Wei-ning, presented a speech on the \"2016 Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report\". The speaker first stated that the emphasis of this research is on the habitability of symbiosis digitalization. With regular observation and measuring, she tracks down the problems occurred during the escape process and propose solutions. In addition, following the field survey of Sub-Shield Project Center and the shelter at Yaochezi on June 2015, another field survey was conducted in January 2016 to observe the geographical changes between these two periods. Members of the team conducted evaluation indicators in accordance to their professional fields and proposed suggestions for field survey and site selection. Finally, the speaker proposed the factors that should be considered and substantive items that individuals, societies, and countries should prepare for future disaster prevention. Next, Miss Su Mei-ju, spoke on \"Viewing Public Art and Environment from the Architecture of Lanyang Museum\". The speaker said that public art originated in the USA in the 1930's and was knowingly followed by many countries causing a trend of public art. The speaker then stated that during the early age of public art development of Taiwan, it was just the display of the ideas or inspiration of the sponsor and had little connection with citizens. After the promulgation of Culture and Arts Reward Act in 1992, it paved way for the development of public art in Taiwan. When installing public arts, creation features such as artistry, commonality and environmental & spatial incorporation degree must be taken into consideration at the same time. Finally, the speaker explained the construction concept of Lanyang Museum, brough about the historical meaning of the building lot, and hoped that its goals of ecological protection and ecological education could achieve the sustainable management spirit of \"being symbiosis with the environment\" and \"integrate with Mother Nature\". Next, Mr. Yao Wei-cheng, spoke on \"The Effects of Climate Changes on Sleep Hygiene and its Countermeasures\". The speaker first stated that both the International Pediatric Sleep Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics state that climate change is a genuine, imminent and serious crisis. we should commit ourselves in preventing the children and human health crisis caused by climate changes. The speaker further said that sleep hygiene means all the different behaviors, environment and measures taken to adjust abnormal sleeping status into normal and quality \"sleeping at night and awake at day\" status. The most critical part of keeping good sleep hygiene is to have regular sleeping-awake cycle and appropriate sleeping time. Ways to help one sleep better includes appropriate exercise, prevent being exposed at the blue lights of consumer electronics, and prevent taking anything that has caffeine, nicotine and alcohol before sleeping. Finally, the speaker reminded everyone that one who maintains good sleep hygiene can prevent being effected by diseases and suggested that people with sleep disorder should see their doctor as soon as possible.

After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Under the affect of climate change, I remind everybody to seize the correct moments to do appropriate things. In the face of the arrival of the digital age, the \"Gig Economy\" has emerged. These emerging sharing economy models represent the development of symbiotic digitalized new civilizations. Moreover, the recent news of the steel quality scandal in Kobe, Japan tells us that maintaining a consistent reputation is very important. I would remind everyone to be prudent in their words and behavior, while making proper decisions.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chou Po-cheng, presented a speech on the \"From International Exchange and Visiting to the Promotion of Local Construction Policy\". The lecturer first mentioned the main events he participated in 2017. Besides stressing the event topic of \"Innovation & Integration\" from WSBE17 Hong Kong, he also mentioned the ideas of sustainable symbiosis and smart health care from the summit forum of Kaohsiung Green Architecture and Building Material Expo. Furthermore, he also visited the zero-carbon architecture technology of Osaka, Japan and explored its application in everyday life and the reactivation of old buildings. He then mentioned techniques on sustainable design at the International Forum on Innovative Low-Carbon and Green Buildings in Subtropical Area. While taking part in these events, he realized that climate change is an irreversible phenomenon, while global warming has caused problems such as the melting of permanent frozen layers and carbon dioxide emission, and reminds everyone to pay attention to these issues. Next, Ms. Su Mei-ju, spoke on \"Case Study on the Preservation of Cultural Heritage: Key Points on Historical Site Preservation\". First, The lecturer first mentioned the definition of cultural heritage and gave us practical examples. For example, Bixia Temple of Yilan City could be preserved through an emphasis on citizens and the administration, in addition to the amendment of Cultural Heritage Preservation Act. The pond in front of Lu's Residence at Toucheng was originally faced with the crisis of being filled up by workers hired by the property owner, but was preserved and repaired due to the notification of the citizens and bulk transfer compensation measures. The Yilan branch of the First Bank was also preserved due to citizen notification and the resilience of its authority. Although private historical sites enjoy many rights such as tax exemption, repairing subsidy, and bulk transfer, they still have obligations such as not being able to relocate, tear or destroy them. She expected that we could all support the promotion of cultural heritage preservation. Next, Mr. Wang Wen-an, spoke on \"Observation on the Architectural Skin of Latitude 13 North and Latitude 31 North\". First, The lecturer first explained that this topic was based 9 degrees north and south of Pingtung, which is Latitude 22 North. Currently, his research topic focuses on climate change adjustment strategies regarding climate warming, including phenomenon such as high temperature, drought, and strong shower. By observing the architecture in Singapore (Latitude 1 North), Bangkok (Latitude 13 North) and Jiangnan, China (Latitude 31 North), he came up with the following concepts: shrink architecture capacity, increase corridors, fragment of space, the increasing of architectural skin to obtain more light and wind, 3-dimensional greening, and shades. From the observation results of these regions, he reflected on how to adjust the preventive restraints regarding architectural skin in Taiwan's architecture laws and wonder if there are more possibilities and breakthrough spaces in them. He said that with the effort of everybody in imputing new ideas, we could then change the environment and cope with climate change! After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The October Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of October 14, 2017, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 14 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to visit Naro Tribe and experience herb growing in Jianshih. It was rainy on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day'sactivities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The focus of the tour was the visit to Naro Tribe, which is primarily an Atayal tribe. The tribe began planting herbs two decades ago but all its herb fields were virtually destroyed due to a destructive typhoon. After over a decade of hard work, the local residents have not only reinvigorated the herb industry but also allowed the world to notice the superior herbs from Taiwan. The tour began with the chairman of Naro Herbs Cooperative introducing the industrial development of the tribe through the slides. He described what happened after the devastation of Typhoon Aere in 2004, and the hardship residents went through to rebuild their homeland and the herb industry. Everyone then tried out herb planting. The tour guide explained the therapeutic effects and uses of various herbs, and the ideal environment for growing them, and also gave everyone tips for growing herbs. By dividing the lemon balm\uff08Melissa officinalis\uff09, cutting the lemon verbena\uff08Verbena officinalis\uff09, and seeding the wild strawberry\uff08Fragaria vesca 'Alexandria'\uff09, everyone learned about herb propagation, and were able to observe the rooting and growing of the plants. After lunch, everyone followed the tour guide to the tribe. Along the way, she pointed out the housing that was destroyed by Typhoon Aere, and the herbs growing on the sides. She particularly mentioned a plant on the roadside that people often eat but rarely see \u2013Job'stears. She explained that Job'stears is not only a therapeutic food but is also often used by the indigenous peoples as a material for bead stringing. In the essential oil extraction plant, the manager explained how the herbs are distilled to separate the essential oils and pure essence, and compared the differences in their quality and effect. The manager also explained that several thousand kilograms of flowers are required to make one kilogram of essential oil, emphasizing the preciousness of their extraction. In the DIY activity that followed, the tour guide introduced the ingredients and effects of the body lotion and perfume that everyone was making, and compared them to products sold in the market.

After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Due to the influence of climate change, temperatures vary drastically. Under such chain reaction, if we were not capable of adapting accordingly, it will cause social turbulence and disputes. Therefore, the younger generation is flexible, their creativity and elaborative capacity is particularly important. On the other hand, due to the successful summit meeting between Trump and Xi, compared to the developed USA, China is currently aggressively pursuing its modernization. Climate change has occurred during China's work to modernize, thus causing great depression when its consumer capacity cannot keep pace, it's worth our attention and observation. Under the current rapid changes, Archlife should establish a new living model to create a new civilization. We want everybody to work hard and be ready for it.\" Later on, the new knowledge keeper to introduce herself to the members. Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Li Yen-yi, presented a speech on the \"Innovation and Warning of Healthy Low Energy Consuming Buildings of Sub-tropical Regions\". The speaker first mentioned that goals for sustainable development must be relevant with the society and economy, while the advent of the Big Data era allowed us to collect more information for further analysis. Under the influence of global warming, its largest impact is the thermal effect. Based on the law of conservation of energy, we know that cold-air outbreaks will occur and cause the death of numerous populations.  However, if heavy rainfall increases while the total rainfall remains unchanged, drought may occur and thus worsen particular matter pollution. Finally, the speaker encouraged everyone to influence more people in their lives and to carry out more meaningful changes that should be carried out as soon as possible from their professional fields. Next, Mr. Li Hung-chien, spoke on \"Sustainable Environment: A Discussion on the Legislation of Rebuilding Old Houses\". The speaker first explained that \"Act for Hastening the Rebuilding the Dangerous and Old Urban Buildings\" was a newly announced law in May 2017. The act stipulated that the application requirements for rebuilding and proposed reward measures such as capacity rate, tax relief, extending building coverage ratio, height restriction and others. It provides dangerous buildings on relatively small plots with a channel, so that they can hasten their rebuilding to ensure the lives and properties of citizens. As for the application period, the act stated that within 10 years after the announcement of the aforementioned act, the application procedure will be simpler and does not require lengthy evaluations. The act expects that with the implementation of urban renewal, the society can achieve a newer, healthier and friendlier living environment! Next, Mr. Yao Wei-cheng, spoke on \"DNA and Fate\". The speaker first mentioned that \"Destiny\" used to mean \"Horoscope\" (eight characters representing one's date and time of birth) traditionally and now it means DNA. \"Destiny\" can be changed by customizing the genetics of babies or accepting HSCT. As for \"Fortune\", it meant traditionally meant variables, while its more relevant with time, space, climate and environment now. Therefore, if one wants to change their \"Fortune\", they have to pay attention to climate change, basic nutrition, education and other factors. There are also many disputes and different perspectives regarding The genetic modification of modern foods, genetically modified organisms and pig organs transplanted into human bodies. Due to the importance of genetic research, the speaker is now preparing to found a database for the organisms of Taiwan. He expects that Taiwan can catch up other countries in this field! After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation, and play \"English Brainstorm\" game.

It was sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. Focusing on discovering the Wushe incident, the study tour was guided by the fifth generation Seediq chief. From the High Speed Rail station, everyone took the van to Alang Gluban. Along the way, the tour guide introduced the traditional culture and everyday habits of the Seediq people, and explained that Seediq Bale means \"real people\". After arriving at Alang Gluban, the chief explained that the Japanese relocated all survivors of the Wushe incident to Kawanakajima, which is modern-day Alang Gluban, in order to prevent vengeance and retribution between the various Wushe tribes. Next, the guided tour moved on to Wushe incident Survivors Memorial Museum, where the chief established the historical background and cause of the Wushe incident. He then described the beginning and end of the Rebellion, the battle routes and number of people who participated in it. The Japanese eventually forced all the rebel tribes to surrender by mounting a counter-offensive and heavy bombardment. Historical photos on the walls of the museum further testified to the indigenous warriors' determination to safeguard their ancestors' cultural legacy and their tribes' dignity. After leaving the museum, the van took everyone to the Wushe area. When passing Renzhiguan, the chief pointed out the precarious cliffs on both sides of the road, explaining that the indigenous people of Wushe successfully prevented the Japanese army from entering the mountain by using the natural barrier but it eventually triggered the Wushe incident. After lunch, the van took everyone to Alang Snuwil where one of the rebel tribe\uff0dGungu, was located. During the archery experience activity, the chief taught everyone the basic archery skill and demonstrated it. The interns were fascinated because it was their first time learning archery.

After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"It has been getting cold lately. As the difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures are high, we would like to remind you to pay attention to how you dress for the weather. It should be able to cope with a minimum temperature difference of 10\u00b0C to adjust to climate change. In addition, we conducted an onsite investigation in China in 1990 to observe how China implemented urbanization and modernization without also considering their correlations with climate change. They may very well be the causes of smog and desertification. Therefore, those in the higher positions should make the correct decisions cautiously. Lastly, I want to thank everybody for submitting papers to the 2018 Archilife Online Expo. The event symbolizes our concerns for human survival issues and continuous efforts to pursue sustainable development.\" Later on, the new knowledge keeper to introduce herself to the members. Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chen Yuan-hung, presented a speech on the \"Accessible Facilities: Practice, Operation, and Case Study\". Chen began with the recent increase in fire accidents, and some of them are correlated to the inappropriate construction of accessible facilities. In outdoor channels, as no guiding sign has been built at the same time, road surface is unsmooth, and tactile ground surface indicators are improperly paved, and wheelchair movements are blocked. With ramp handrails, continuous handrails should be installed and a hook and impact proof treatment should be made on both sides of the ramp. According to Chen, the absence of ramps at entrances is a common problem in buildings, and this can be improved by installing moveable ramps and elevation platforms. Chen presented many pictures as examples for attendees to recognize the expertise of accessible facilities and the importance of their construction. Next, Ms. Li Chun-ju, spoke on \"Urban Construction for Modern Needs and Challenges\". She began with the decision-making of governments and enterprises to express her concerns about land development in Taiwan and its relevance with the global environment. She continued with the Taichung Urban Design Awards which award architectural works that contribute to urban development. The rating principles include urban charity and life concerns and the suitability for the climate and spatial scale of Taichung. Li presented many examples of buildings that co-exist with nature and create natural, multilevel vegetation and vertical greening, and interact with communities with outdoor scenery. Lastly, Li mentioned the need for adaptation in the symbiosis between people and nature, how old and new buildings find a way to address climate change, and there are many to realize to achieve the symbiosis concept of Archilife. Next, Wang Min-chou, spoke on \"The Turn of Housing Issues in Changes: Affordable Housing\".  At the beginning, Wang explained that affordable housing has its temporal spirit. In this speech, he introduced the affordable housing in southern and northern Taiwan. According to him, the Jiankang Community in Taipei has three types of units: one room, two rooms, and three rooms. They are simple but functionally integral for universal use. The Taipei City Government encourages creative residents to move in. Wang continued with the Jianguo Community in Fengshan District, Kaohsiung City. The community was previously a 19 unit apartment building owned by the Urban Development Bureau. It was demolished and re-built into affordable housing for the effective use of building space and offers a comfortable living environment to citizens to build a sweet home.

The tour guide also introduced the background of the orchard and its tropical trees, and the appearance, taste and method of eating tropical fruits that are not common in Taiwan. When everyone was inside the orchard, the tour guide explained about seasonal fruits in the orchard. In particular, the Pouteria caimito, has a collagen-rich and sticky pulp. After cutting the fruit, the sticky residue on the knife is difficult to remove. An easy way to remove the sticky residue is to heat the knife over fire before wiping it. Besides learning about tropical fruits, everyone also went to pluck the ripe fruits and savor their tastes. After lunch, everyone went to visit a farm. To avoid diseases that can spread between animals and humans, protective clothing had to be worn. Led by farm personnel, the first place visited was the dairy area where the Holstein Friesian cattle, known for their high milk production and stable quality, were raised. Farm personnel explained that they opened a small hole in the stomach of healthy cattle to extract gastric juice rich in microorganisms so as to help other cattle with digestive problems to restore their health quickly. Next, everyone moved to the poultry area. Farm personnel explained that although the silkie chicken has white plumage, its other body parts are black, including skin, flesh, crest and feet. Moreover, it has five toes on each foot instead of four. In the final part of the tour, everyone visited the soil and water conservation outdoor classroom. Stopping at the lake, the tour guide briefly introduced the surrounding ecological environment and the lake's function as a downstream detention basin. Along the upstream banks are drainage ditches and gabion, which slow water flow and scouring, and thus preventing the slope from collapsing and water can flow smoothly toward the detention basin. Through the soil and water conservation facilities in the campus, the interns developed a deeper understanding of the concept and applications of soil and water conservation. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end.

Everyone continued to walk to Kaishan Mansion and Lengyange. The former was built by the second-generation abbot of Lingyun Buddhist Temple while the latter was built by his oldest disciple. Both buildings were built during the Japanese Occupation using stones from Guanyinshan. They're unique religious buildings that feature a fusion of different styles of architecture, including the Indian-style domed roof, southern Fujian-style corridors and Baroque-style fa\u00e7ade. Upon returning to the event venue, a member of the Wild Bird Society explained the reasons, method and route for the migration of the birds of prey. It is commonly believed that as autumn approaches and the climate becomes harsh and food is insufficient, these birds of prey migrate to the south where food is abundant while they await the warmer weather in spring when they will fly back north to mate and nest. The larger birds have wings that are over one meter long when fully spread out. Utilizing thermal, these birds are able to save energy and glide across the sky, allowing them to fly higher and further. Observing birds of prey and Taiwan barbet through a telescope at the eagle viewing platform, everyone was thrilled to see the splendor of the birds as they flew low over the skyline. After lunch, everyone went to the briefing room and watched a documentary film about the Oriental honey buzzards of Ninety-nine Peaks.

Everyone witnessed how hot the steam was when the tour guide poured cold water in and the water immediately started boiling. The last leg of the day's tour was the Zhuzihu Ponlai Rice Foundation Seed Field Story House. Divided into different themes, the Story House explains the reasons why Zhuzihu was the original planting field for Japonica rice, and tells the story of Iso Eikichi and Suenaga Megumu, and even has life-size figurines demonstrating manual threshing, allowing interns to understand the post-harvesting process more easily. At that point, the day's activities came to an end, everyone took a photo together before going their separate ways and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The July Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2017 was held on July 23, 2017. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The G20 meeting held in Hamburg Germany recently ended. However, the compliance with the IPCC report resulted in effectiveness. Archilife again would like to emphasize the concept of \"before Continuity; After Tomorrow\". In order to achieve sustainability we must first pass the harsh test of climate change, for only when we make it through is there tomorrow. I would like to share an English proverb with all, \"Easy choices, hard life; hard choices, easy life\". I would like to remind everyone the importance of making the right decisions when faced with many choices in life. People tend to feel agitated in chaotic situations. Remember to do what is right when under pressure, since the \"conservative, conservative, and more conservative\" way of doing things will get you farther. Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Cheng Wei-ning, presented a speech on the \"2017 Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report\". The speaker first explained that the focus of this stage lies in strengthening the specific plan with regard to the livability of the Archilife Sub-Shield Center, as well as the pre-cautionary matters required of all levels when evacuation needs arise in case it becomes no longer livable. The speaker then introduced the way to visit the Archilife Sub-shield Center through a video introduction. Through periodic observations and tests, problems arising from the \"back to the wild\" process were targeted for tracking. In addition, problems encountered in different aspects, food, clothing, living, non-transportation, education, and entertainment were  targeted to come up with solutions. Finally, with the Archilife Sub-shield Center as the starting point, the speaker looked forward to seeing all thinking about how to head towards the future, so that Taiwan will find itself leading the world. Next, Mr. Gao Chuan-chi, spoke on \"Life map- the map of life and living\". The speaker first mentioned that at present, in addition to continuing to carry forward the cultural assets of the ancestors' life wisdom, the life map is also a very important concept to gain an insight into the course of life of 30 people from five generations and to trace the roots. From the daily artifacts from the past retained and texts, to the image records of the extrinsic city marks, see the greatness of the city all over again. The lecturer also deeply plowed his hometown with his professional knowledge. He has held many cultural activities, combined with the development of cultural industries, highlighting the characteristics of localization. With the local living map as the starting point, creativity can be aroused to create many interesting images and works, thereby achieving the purpose of introducing \"the local features of Chia-La (the old name of Southern Wanhua, Taipei),\" in the hope of drawing more people to become concerned about the land we all grew up in. Next, Mr. Tsai Kun-hsien, spoke on \"The Introduction of Regulations of Grading Housing Performance\". The speaker first said that everyone should observe the surroundings in order to discover the symbiotic changes. Recently, the speaker has also cooperated with the EPA to conduct infectious disease prevention courses and dengue fever related health education, In addition to responding to public consultations and offering assistance and solutions, we should make an effort to fully understand the environmental problems. During the dengue fever introduction, the intern present were also invited to make demonstrations, so that everyone would understand the symptoms of the disease. Finally, the speaker said that an average household has more than one hundred organisms, and killing home pests with insecticides is bound to cause harm to the environment. People should recognize there are many beneficial organisms in the environment and that people should learn to co-exist with them. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The July Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of July 15, 2017, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 26 ARF interns and their parents on a discovery tour to Chiayi to learn about insect ecology and Asian art and culture. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The morning's itinerary began with a visit to NCYU Insect Museum. Focusing on ecological education, the museum provides a place for visitors to get up close and personal with insects, allowing them to understand the importance of life and nature conservation. The tour began with DIY aiyu jelly washing. The tour guide firstly introduced the origin of aiyu jelly and explained its dietary benefits using educational flash cards. This was then followed by explanation of the steps and tips for washing aiyu jelly, and instruction on differentiating real and fake aiyu jelly sold in the market. The next part of the tour was to the insect terrarium area of the museum. The tour guide removed insects from the terrarium to allow everyone to observe and touch them, and explained their characteristics and habits. Unlike ordinary insect museums where only specimens are put on display, the NCYU Insect Museum allows interns to gain more knowledge through interactive learning. The tour ended with a visit to the butterfly garden greenhouse, which is modeled after Taiwan's low-and mid-altitude primeval forests and water sources. The tour guide explained the connection between plants, water sources and butterfly ecology. Interns not only could interact with butterflies, they also witnessed what the butterfly looked like before and after metamorphosis. After lunch, everyone took a ride to the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum in Taibao City, Chiayi County. Set as an \"Asian Art and Culture Museum\", the Southern Branch Museum seeks to achieve culture equity between the Northern and the Southern regions of Taiwan. The tour began with a focus on the developmental history of Chiayi. The museum presents the economic and political systems in the early days of Chiayi, and its indigenous culture and native environment, through ancient books, maps and Qing Dynasty written records, allowing visitors to learn about the development of early Chiayi from various perspectives. Next, everyone visited the Buddhist art exhibition, where Buddhist sculptures and sutras portray the diversity of Asian Buddhist art and its cultural depth. In the Asian textiles exhibition area, the myriad variety of textile systems in Asia reflects its geographical vastness and diversity. Everyone also learned about the origin of Chinese tea, the beauty of Korean celadon and exquisite craftsmanship of South Asian jade. The interns gained a preliminary impression of Asian history after viewing these artistic accomplishments from the peak of Asian civilization. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The August Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2017 was held on August 27, 2017. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Since the establishment of the Archilife Research Foundation in 1978, we have been regarded experience, research, design, execution, and promotion as the basic scopes of ARCHILIFE. Many members here grew together with Archilife. I expect that the ideals of Archilife can be transmitted to the new generation interns. In addition, on the day of liqiu (the start of autumn), the temperature was as high as 38.5\u00b0C. It serves as salient evidence of the impact of climate change. Then, the Antichrist, famine, plague, and more will lead to wars. I would like to remind you all to observe things objectively and calmly to pay closer attention to changes, and handle daily affairs more carefully.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chou Yu-ching, presented a speech on the \"NHI PharmaCloud System\". First, the speaker mentioned that there are three major health issues in Taiwan: the three hyper-series, cancer, and ageing. The problems for elderly people are that multiple medical consultations and repetition of medication. It may cause side effects because of interaction of different drugs. To avoid repetitious prescriptions, repetitious intake of medicine by patients, the NHI launched the PharmaCloud System on July 2013 by integrating cloud technology and patients centered management. The speaker continued to explain the contents of the medicine in the past three months. Although the research data show that it can help improve the problem of repeated medication, it creates controversies because of the implementation of Personal Information Protection Act. It will cause inconveniences to patients collecting medicine in advance and difficulties in integrating the system. It is hoped that holding conferences on the issue of system integration can solve in the future all these problems. Next, Ms. Yu Hsiu-yun, spoke on \"Future Development of Chinese Education\". First, the speaker mentioned the Chinese Teachers Cultivation Examination Committee emphasizes on the cultivation teachers that are complied with the basic curricula. The vision of the 12-Year National Fundamental Education is to cultivate young people with the goals talent-praising well and lifelong learning. They can accumulate experiences from the everyday life situations, and learn to cope with the social changes, as well as the ability of independent thinking and capability to response to various situations. At present, the Ministry of Education is promoting the multiple promotion schemes in colleges and universities, and teachers' self-promotion from teaching practices. It will be helpful in professional Chinese teaching. In the future, students can present their concerns and insights in the field of language, and the topics on social, economic, and environmental issues related to climate change. Next, Mr. Lin Chin-yuan, spoke on \"New Ideas of Hakka Community in the Mountain (Lishan)\u2013Stone Walls, Dates, and Taros\". First, the speaker explained that \"Lishan\" is the buffer between high mountains and flat lands. If we can create an environment with biodiversity, and introduce recycling economy here, it will create changes for human life. The speaker used the Golden Town Leisure and Agricultural Zone in Miaoli as example, the farmers sign will sign a pact for a friendly environment to promote the harvest of red dates, and use their intelligent to solve the difficulties of the poor sales of tangerine. In addition, he also proposed to promote the growing of pesticide-free taro with living things as indicators. Likewise, people can eat it with peace of mind. Finally, the speaker hoped that with the spirit of the fulfillment of \"Lishan,\" it is possible to create economic benefits for farmers, and promote the improvement of overall environment in order to achieve the goals of food education and food safety. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The August Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of August 26, 2017, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 25 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to visit Nantou's Endemic Species Research Institute and experience farming in Puli. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The morning's itinerary began with a visit to the Endemic Species Research Institute, which aims to promote local ecological education so as to draw greater attention to the concept of wildlife conservation. Introducing \"the  worship of Tree Deity\" in the early days, the tour guide began by explaining the interdependent relationship between humanity and nature since time immemorial, and emphasized that environmental conservation is important as the pursuit of economic development has resulted in environmental destruction and near extinction of many species. Moving into a cave encased by tree roots, the tour guide introduced the different types of roots by illustrations, explaining that different roots are evolved to adapt to different environments. The tour guide also explained how water travels up from the root, and which part of the root to handle first when transplanting a tree in order not to affect the roots' ability to draw water. Next, the tour guide explained the different types of forest, and characteristics of flora and fauna, according to their altitudes, reflecting the rich diversity of Taiwan's ecological resources despite its subtropical location. Finally, in the spider exhibition area, interns learned about the different types of spider and their ecology from the extensive collection of specimens and display boards. Besides trapping preys and attracting mates with their webs, spiders are also good at disguising and blending in with the environment to hide from their predators. Some spiders living in the wetland can even glide over water surfaces and submerge themselves in water to avoid their predators, contrary to what everyone had imagined. Lunch was local specialties at a water bamboo farm in Puli. After lunch, the farm owner explained that water bamboo is not really bamboo but the stem of the rice grass\uff08Zizania latifolia\uff09, which swells into what is known as water bamboo when infected by the fungus, Ustilago esculenta. Everyone then donned waders and learned how to identify ripe water bamboo and walk properly in the water field. The farm owner also introduced the characteristics of duckweed and its functions, and birds nesting on the water bamboo plants and other symbiotic organisms. The hands-on experience provided the interns deeper understanding of farm ecology. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The September Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2017 was held on September 17, 2017. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Though we are already entering autumn, the temperature is still high. This can make us feel irritated. Therefore, the NT Special Team of Archlife continues to research the anomalies in Taiwan's climate change in order to seek responsive measures. In addition, the Living Special Group also continues to discuss practical projects regarding the livability of Archlife Sub-Shield Center in order to combine its accommodation specs for the next generation with the ideas of a symbiotic eco-sphere, and expect to pass the tests of climate change. Finally, I have to remind everyone that due to great daily temperature difference, please pay attention to your physical status and acquire more knowledge in order to respond to the rapidly changing world.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Li Shu-an, presented a speech on the \"Introduction into Respirators Project\". First, the speaker mentioned that respirators are devices that help the wearer to protect themselves from air pollutants. Selecting and wearing respirators correctly enables them to demonstrate their actual protective effects under climate change. Current legal regulations only demand employers to provided respirators to laborers and have yet to demand the compilation of any rules regarding respirator projects. Therefore, he suggested that respirator projects and demands should be clearly stated in the Rules on Occupational Safety and Health Facilities. He then introduced various respirator forms with pictures, stressed the importance of seal tightness, and knowing how to use them correctly. Next, Ms. Sun Ruei-suei, spoke on \"Gender and Environment: Gender Issues in Public Environments\". First, the speaker explained that the relationship between gender and the environment has become a major agenda in Western countries, while Taiwan is still working hard to promote it. The separation of social spaces, such as women-only cars, while good-intentioned, has caused disputes. As for working environment discrimination, different payment for the same work is still a common phenomenon. Discrimination also occurs due to gaps in technology and skills. Ms. Sun then explained that mainstream gender movements expect to change the situation of gender inequality through government policies and resource distribution. Currently, the Gender Equality Committee of the Executive Yuan has promoted gender equality polices according to CEDAW and attempts to influence various fields. Finally, Ms. Sun stated that although the promotion of gender equality in Taiwan has gained progress over ten years. It should continue to be promoted in the environment, urban design,and public art aesthetics. Next, Mr. Lin Yu-yi, spoke on \"Proactive Disaster Prevention: Management of Artificial Slopes\". First, the speaker explained that the collapse of slopes is a movement of solids that creates an occurrence area and an accumulation area, while a mudslide is a movement of fluids that creates an occurrence area, a flow area, and an accumulation area. Although the distance of the slope buffer strip is clearly stipulated in the Technical Regulations for Soil and Water Conservation, it is questionable whether this distance is adequate. Take Taipei City for example, its five major mountain systems are located near residential areas and have resulted in various slope disasters in the past years. Maintenance and management should be taken care of to prevent and reduce risks. Therefore, on the principle of slope risk sorting and classification management, Mr. Lin has investigated and made an archive of more than 20,000 slope data points. Users can refer to this information by entering serials codes or addresses at the website of the Geotechnical Engineering Office. In recent years, the slope management of national and provincial highways has started, symbolizing the proactive influence of such measures. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The September Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of September 9, 2017, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 21 ARF interns and their parents on a trip to discover the everyday wisdom of residents in century-old Bangka. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The focus of the trip was a visit to Wanhua District. Mr. Gao Chuan-chi was the tour guide. At the start of the trip, Mr. Gao brought everyone to Bangka Park and described the unique phenomenon that occurs within the facilities of the park\uff0dthe elderly gather to drink tea and play chess in the day while the homeless huddle in the same park at night. Upon arriving at the historic Bopiliao area, Mr. Gao explained that the historic area that is being promoted for its local culture is what it is today after the government's expropriation, the residents' relocation and restoration of the old street. However, only vacant houses remained. Without actual residents, it is regretful that one can only imagine what the old street used to look like in the past. At U-mkt, Mr. Gao talked about the rise and fall of the market since the Japanese Occupation, and explained how an old building can be transformed into a multifunctional event hall, teaching everyone the concept and real-life example of how an old heritage can be reborn. Everyone continued walking and arrived at the Heritage and Culture Education Center to view the \"Wanhua Impression Exhibition\". Myriad objects representing Wanhua were on display at the exhibition, as well as creative works by local students. The exhibition depicted the history, culture and changes that have taken place in the last century. The interns gained a deeper understanding of people and culture in the Bangka district by playing a special monopoly game. After lunch, everyone walked to the underground street at Longshan Temple, which was originally an old mall where the homeless nearby tend to congregate. Fear of these homeless people had deterred the public from shopping at the mall, resulting in slow business for the mall. In recent years, with Wanhua District promoting its unique culture and creative industries, and the government establishing regulations and boundaries on the activities of the homeless, there has been significant improvement to the mall's image. After leaving the underground street, everyone went to the Huajiang Resettled Tenement Communities. Mr. Gao talked about its unique architecture and functions. Connected by four bridges, the arcade on the second floor has become a \"skywalk\" for residents to spend their leisure time. The final part of the tour brought everyone to Sugar Refinery Cultural Park. The park showcases many types of equipment, tools and documents, used in the sugar refinery in the past, and it provides a brief history of the sugar warehouse, giving everyone a better understanding of the development of the sugar industry in northern Taiwan.

Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The October Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on October 14, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"11 years have passed since the SB07 Taipei International Conference hosted by the TSSBE, the Architectural Institute of Taiwan will host the \"2018 Conference on Innovative Low-Carbon and Green Buildings in Subtropical Area\", in the hopes of passing on the concept of digitalization of life and symbiosis with nature to the international community. According to a recent report published by the United Nations IPCC, the global average temperature will rise by 1.5\u2103 as soon as 2030, which will trigger more natural disasters. Therefore, we still host the \"Archilife Riddle Guess\" this month, to guide everyone to continue to pay attention to the impact of climate change.\" Secretary General Huang Chin-ying subsequently announced the answer to the 2018 \"Archilife Riddle Guess\", and she presented the prize, a pressure-type thermo hygrometer, to the winner, intern Ms. Tsai Ting-yu. Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chen Kai-ling presented a speech on the \"Airport MRT Construction and Operation\". He started off by stating that the construction of the Airport MRT commenced in June 2006, and was officially open to the public in March 2017. Problems faced during the period included some construction issues and insufficient preparation for operational readiness. Therefore, both the central and local government signed a memorandum of cooperation in 2015 to jointly resolve any unsatisfactory areas or problematic issues. Mr. Chen stated that Taiwan's future railway development hinges on the availability of core software systems. As of February 2018, the Airport MRT has transported over 20 million passengers, with greater than estimated revenues. The Airport MRT has fulfilled its purpose to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions while offering the public a convenient means of transport. Next, Ms. Chang Yu-tung spoke on \"Kaohsiung Beach Restoration Project\". She started off by touching on the \"Hamasen Restoration Project\", to gradually restore historical Hamasen to its previous glory. Ms. Chang supplemented her presentation with historical photographs, which allowed participants to witness the changing face of Shaochuantou and Syongjhen North Gate. By 1875, Shaochuantou was already an international trading commercial port. Roads were built along the embanked quay, which was taken to refer to the \"bund\". Shaochuantou gradually became deserted after the Japanese occupation and the post-war period. With the rise of the tourism industry in recent years, the Kaohsiung City Government has spared no effort in restoring Syongjhen North Gate and the Shaochuantou port area, in the hopes of preserving cultural assets while driving its transformation from commerce to tourism, to bring glory back to the Hamasen area. Next, Mr. Chen Yuan-hung spoke on \"An Operational Assessment of the Statute for Expediting Reconstruction of Urban Unsafe and Old Buildings\". First,  according to statistical data, there are 3.84 million old houses across Taiwan that are above 30 years of age and need reconstruction. The Construction and Planning Agency of the Ministry of the Interior also supported the move to inspect and reconstruct old housing by providing financial assistance and preliminary and detailed assessment of earthquake resistance, to help the public understand and improve the structural safety of their homes. Mr. Chen went on to explain key details in the \"Statute for Expediting Reconstruction of Urban Unsafe and Old Buildings\". To accelerate the improvement of the living environment via the reconstruction of dilapidated and old urban buildings in areas targeted for urban redevelopment, the Construction and Planning Agency introduced various incentives such as greater plot ratios, tax reductions, and less stringent greater building coverage ratios and height limits. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The October Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of October 20, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 20 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to learn about dried persimmon in Xinpu and experience making grass jelly in Guanxi. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning's itinerary brought everyone to Jinhan Dried Persimmon Education Farm where the farm owner was the tour guide. The tour began\u3000with the introduction to the different types of persimmon and their characteristics and growth environment. The tour guide explained that fruits of the same persimmon tree will vary in shape depending on whether they are pollinated. Those with a more pointed bottom are pollinated while those with a rounder bottom are not pollinated. He then invited everyone to try a small piece of astringent persimmon to experience the sensory impact of the \"astringent\" taste. He explained that astringent persimmon contains soluble tannic acid which causes the astringent taste. Eating it directly will cause mouth dryness and puckering. The only way to get rid of the astringent taste is \"sweetness\". Once everyone took a bite of dried persimmon, the astringent taste immediately disappeared, proving that sweetness and astringent bitterness complement each other. Using the experience, the tour guide explained that astringent persimmons growing at low altitude can only be eaten after the astringent taste is removed. There are three ways to remove the astringent taste, i.e. peel off the skin and dry out the fruit, soaking the fruit to make crispy persimmon, and placing it together with apple to ripen and soften it. He particularly emphasized that the white powder on the dried persimmon is crystallized sugar that comes from within the persimmon. It is not mold and has the restorative effect of stopping cough and lubricating the lungs. After lunch, the tour group made its way to Guanxi Mesona Museum's ecological farm. The farm owner, who acted as the tour guide, began the tour by bringing everyone to learn about fruit trees, particularly pointing out the easy-to-miss mesona. He talked about the origin of the mesona's name, and its restorative effect. While showing everyone what the dried mesona looked like, he explained that the plant has to be harvested by uprooting the plant using a hoe, wind dried in the field and placed in the warehouse for about a year. To make into jelly form, it has to be washed and boiled, and starch has to be added to the strained liquid. The final part of the study tour was a trip to Chin-Yong DIY Recreation Farm where over 30 species of tomatoes are grown. The tour guide explained that the species are mostly imported from overseas and are uncommon in Taiwan. She also compared the differences in their shape, color and nutritional value. Everyone tried their hands at harvesting tomatoes and learned to observe their different characteristics, expanding their knowledge of everyday fruits and vegetables. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The November Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on November 11, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Recently, there are many incidents happening around the world, causing turbulent situations, such as the hail fall on Rome, Venice being flooded, the trade war between China and USA, the mid-term election in USA and others. Therefore, the Archlife Foundation has trained its members for a long time with the purpose of expecting everyone to contribute their effort to this country and society when needed. We also ask everyone to be prepared. In addition, external environmental changes will result in social changes and law amendments accordingly. I expect everyone to cope with the time and circumstances accordingly to prevent malpractices. Finally, I would like to share the slogan of \"FORTUNE\", representing Face the problem\u3001On time\u3001Risking you can afford first\u3001Thank you\u3001Under my management will definitely get better\u3001Name is signed, you need to keep your promise\u3001Early bird gets the worm\". I hope everyone can implement it in the guidelines.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Wang Wen-an presented a speech on the \"Besides Sustainability: New Actions in Constructing Campus Aesthetics\". The speaker first mentioned that in the series of operations under sustainable campuses, the most important issue is to nurture the next generation's ecological knowledge and their understanding of sustainability. Aesthetic education has been emphasized in recent years, enabling children to be educated with aesthetics, helping students to have better personalities. The speaker also mentioned many examples, such as Fuxing Junior High School of Yilan City that has made toilets dancing spaces, Taiwu Elementary School of Taiwu Township, Pingtung County that has linked ancestral spirits with learning, and Micang Elementary School of Bali District, New Taipei City that embraces old trees. He expects that with the enhancement of the aesthetic literacy of the next generation, the spiritual civilization of mankind can be improved. Next, Ms. Su Mei-ju spoke on \"How Can Local Knowledge be Remembered: the Case of Yilan in the National Culture Memory Base\". The speaker first mentioned that local knowledge can express local unique ways of life and cultural features. Therefore, the Ministry of Culture has promoted the National Culture Memory Base project and the promotion and application of knowledge, enabling them to be constantly accumulated and applied innovatively. The speaker then mentioned the 3D establishment project that included 210 collection items from 11 public and private galleries carried out by Lanyang Museum on 2018 that has become an important route for distant cultural research. The speaker then mentioned the Yilan Space 30 Project and listed the represented landscape cases of Yilan for the past 30 years as the foundation of related researches. Next, Mr. Yao Wei-cheng spoke on \"Prospect of Genetic Technology and Medical Big Data under Climate Change\". The speaker first mentioned that when taking parallel medical treatments under similar symptoms, examination results and similar diseases, there are still different effects. It may be due not by adhering to prescriptions, cross medical effects, probability (luck), or physical condition (genetic) factors. The development of precise medicine is to conduct a cross analysis with medical records, biological and medical examinations with personal information such as family history, race and physical genetic database to select the best treatment for patients. The difficulties of big data are on its comprehensiveness, right of privacy and talents that can develop big data. She also expected that through the integrated application of medical big data, doctors can make the most appropriate treatment for their patients. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The November Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of November 18, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 22 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to Sanxia Old Street to learn about its history and culture, and try their hands on creative metalwork. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The tour began with a visit to Atop Time Arts Pavilion in the morning. Using the sun, moon, mountains and rivers as the theme, the tour guides explained the reason for the cycle of day and night, and the four seasons each year, giving the interns some background understanding of the Earth's rotation and revolution. She said that we could perceive the relationship between time and people by observing the traces left by living things, e.g. tree ring, the frequency of beats per minute pulse rate and shelf life of foods. The interns were urged to smell the difference between new vinegar and old vinegar, and use their senses to learn about their surroundings and become aware of the flow of time. The tour guides then explained that time zones of the world are based on Greenwich Mean Time, teaching everyone the simple way to calculate time differences for places in the world. Referring to the quartz stone, precision measuring instruments and related equipment on display, the tour guides explained how a quartz watch works and the manufacturing process for its internal mechanism. In the process, the tour guides also used a thickness gauge to measure the thickness of interns' hair to show the degree of precision and intricacy of the parts and components of a watch. After lunch, Mr. Su from Sanchiaoyung Cultural Promotion Association led the group on a tour of Sanxia Old Street. Mr. Su began by describing the origin and development of indigo dyeing in Sanxia, and the procedure of extracting indigo dye from the assam indigo plant (Strobilanthes cusia). Located on the plain where the Dahan River, Sanxia River and Heng River meet, Sanxia was originally called \"Sanchiaoyung\", meaning the \"delta of three rivers\", and used to be an important trade town for tea leaves, camphor and dyed fabric. Mr. Su made a special effort to teach everyone how to interpret the signboards on the shophouses. Mr. Su also explained the architectural design of Baroque-style building and red brick archways. Arriving at Sanxia Zushi Temple, Mr. Su explained that the restoration of the temple was led by master painter Li Mei-shu. Sculptures within the temple depict stories of loyalty, filial piety, integrity and righteousness, and integrate elements of both Eastern and Western cultures, and combine styles of different craftsmen, giving the temple its reputation as the temple of Eastern arts. The final part of the tour brought everyone to participate in metalwork DIY activity. Although all the participants had difficulty grasping the hitting technique at first, they soon improved after making much effort and eventually completed their unique works.

The December Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of December 15, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 11 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to discover the secrets of the Formosan Sambar Deer and the underground empire of the ants in Taoyuan. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The tour began with a visit to Sanjiao Deer Farm in the morning. The tour guide started off with a short animation film. It explained that deer shed their antlers every year, and each antler begins to divide into branches when the deer are two years old, finally forming three points and two branches. Deer antler velvet is the precalcified antler of the buck, and is mostly harvested from the sambar deer, sika deer and red deer by professionals when they are approximately two years old. The Formosan sambar deer has conspicuous preorbital glands (located under the eyes) which dilate when they are angry or excited, giving them the name of \"four-eyed deer\", and they are mainly used to secrete scent to establish their dominance or attract the opposite sex. The tour also included a race event, allowing interns to experience the difference in speed between a deer and human, and a milk feeding session which encouraged the interns to love and care for animals. After lunch, everyone headed to Ant Home, an ecological museum which aims to promote the concept of environmental conservation and improving the home environment. The tour guide, Mr. Hou Xiu-wei, began by introducing ants as one of few species of social insects. Within each ant colony are four groups of ants, including the queens, workers, soldiers and male ants with identifiable characteristics and responsibilities. The tour guide taught everyone how to differentiate an ant nest and hornet nest; the former usually looks like a string of beads wrapped around a tree branch with many openings while the latter is hung on a tree branch with only one opening. The tour guide also warned of the risk of misjudging due to lighting. Thus, if one discovers such a nest during outdoor activities, one should leave it alone. When chased by hornets, it is prudent to run in the direction of the wind, or throw two handfuls of loose dirt toward them to block your scent and escape immediately. Next, the tour guide explained the hazards caused by red imported fire ants, and government regulations to prevent and solve the problem, and explained how to get rid of them by using natural, non-toxic method. In the final part of the tour, everyone was able to observe the characteristics and scent of different types of ants through the museum's artificial nests, and saw how the ants divide their labor capturing their prey and moving it when a worm was thrown near the nest. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The January Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on January 14, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"In light of the recent cold weather, the President has instructed to suspend the Wormhole Bookish Assembly twice, thus we hereby remind people to observe fluctuations in temperature and prepare accordingly. Global warming causes an increase in temperature and forces atmospheric moisture to rise; since there is less moisture in the air, direct exposure to sunlight in the day, coupled with heat loss during the night, results in drastic temperature fluctuations. Consequently, moisture in humidity is a key factor in creating temperature fluctuations. In addition, digitization as a form of payment instrument has fostered the emergence of the online economy, causing increased carbon emissions, therefore Archilife NT Special Team and Living Special Team have worked closely, hoping to respond to future challenges by transforming people's lifestyle.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chang Chen-chung gave a presentation on \"Creative rebirth of cultural heritage\". The speaker first elaborated on the numerous approaches to the management right and charge of cultural heritage, including corporate adoption. Next, the speaker presented case studies involving the revitalization of an old industrial site in Germany, transforming it into an amusement venue, as well as the Gasometer housing project in Vienna that reconstructed abandoned gas tanks into residences. The projects emanate creativity and have preserved the value of cultural heritages. Furthermore, the Taipei City Urban Regeneration Office launched the URS (Urban Regeneration Station) program in 2010 to sow the seeds of cultural creativity into the old streets. Lastly, the speaker indicated that there is an abundant collection of cultural heritages that need to be revitalized through creative transformation. Next, Mr. Shao Wen-cheng, spoke on \"Green construction material research and industry development trend in 2018\". The speaker first mentioned that, in order to avoid toxic substances from entering the environment due to the application of materials, the green construction material and healthy environment study was conducted. Currently, the green construction label launched by Taiwan Architecture & Building Center focuses on the aftermarket inspection mechanism to rigorously uphold the credibility of the label through stringent management. Moreover, in order to minimize construction related disputes, the \"Green construction certification system\" was formulated to control regulations related to the aspects such as construction environment, green construction, construction material and air quality inspection. Lastly, the speaker commented that the 9 major building indicators and planning and design standards of \"Healthy residences\" will be formulated in the future. Next, Mr. Tai Yung-ti, spoke on \"Low carbon community and low carbon, sustainable home\". The speaker first explained the mechanism of low carbon sustainable home certification, as well as the bottom-up expansion into a low carbon sustainable living circle. In an effort to promote the low carbon eco-friendly neighborhood program, the Department of Environmental Protection, Taoyuan convened a selection committee meeting to let the advisory team help various applicants adjust their neighborhood programs and have their budgets approved. However, due to the short-term nature of the program and low remuneration received by the advisory team, subsequent professional support may not be available. Lastly, the speaker suggested that since the Green Silicon Island concept was mentioned over a decade ago, every effort has been made to help achieve the ambition. It is hoped that starting from sustainable schools, the concept can be expanded to every facet of life in a progressive manner. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation.

At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The focus of this study tour was the NPUST campus. The first stop visited was the Pingtung Rescue Center where everyone had to wear a mask to prevent the possibility of contacting zoonotic diseases. The volunteer guide explained that the rescued wild animals had been victims of wildlife trafficking, illegal breeding, pet abandonment or cruel treatment. They are kept at the rescue center as their health and state of mind do not allow them to be released into the wild or be sent to animal shelters with better resources despite proper care by the rescue center. Due to insufficient space, the rescue center usually places animals of compatible temperament in the same cage and tries to maintain a living environment similar to their habitat. For instance, ducks are kept in the monkey enclosure. Not only do they keep each other company but the ducks eat up food that the monkeys drop while hanging from the trees. Ducks also eat snails on the ground to keep the ground clean and reduce the monkeys' risk of falling sick from parasites on the snails. After listening to anecdotes of animals at the rescue center, the message that \"when the buying stops, the killing can too\" becomes ingrained in everyone's mind. After lunch, everyone visited the Exhibition Hall of Agricultural Implements. The volunteer guide began by showing everyone the ox-drawn cart used in early agricultural society, encouraging everyone to think about how farmers carry out their farm work before the advent of automated equipment. Then the guide introduced the traditional farm equipment, and let interns operate some of the displayed equipment to understand the hardship and difficulty of farm work. Next, the guide described the farm life in early Taiwan by pointing to a recreated setting on display. She explained how seats in the main hall are arranged according to seniority. The final part of the tour brought everyone to the working dogs training center. The guide began by explaining the meaning of working dogs, and that they are divided into assistance dogs that assist humans in everyday life and detection dogs that use their acute sense of smell. The former include guide dog, hearing dog while the latter refer to drug dog and brown root rot disease detection dog. This was followed by a demonstration of how a working dog detects brown root rot disease and how a hearing dog assists hearing impaired people respond to surrounding sound changes in their everyday living. Everyone observed the benefits that working dogs bring to people and the living environment. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone returned to home after taking a group photo and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The March Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on March 18, 2018.

He first mentioned the launch of global climate change conferences in Oct., 2004 and a serial study on temperature prediction models and country climate risk assessment in the follow-up years. Numeric indicators adopted for the study were national disaster relief, temperature gradients, vegetation, and extreme climate events as well as earthquakes, famines, and diseases, which were subsequently taken into consideration. Based on both relative history and changes in contemporary trends, the NT Special Team located and outlined the looks of disasters tomorrow and the survival strategies thereof, while explaining that climate change is essentially drastic changes and an uneven distribution of energy. Lastly, the keynote speaker pointed out it was NT Special Team's mission to try ceaselessly to approach the constant eternity in the face of constant changes in the climate. Next, Mr. Hung Chi-tung, spoke on \"Resilient City and Sustainable Development: Shared Experience\". He first described his studies and publication over the past year, during which period he also attended international conferences in Vienna, Austria and Canada where he spoke about spatial development in the towns of Hsinchu County, Taiwan and explosions in Tianjin Harbor, China. He also pointed out the disputes over and complexities about land use rezoning in urban planning from lands used by administrative authorities and reserved lands to residential lands. The key to promote resilient and sustainable cities is disaster resilience with synergy from merging community disaster prevention with community development, emphasis on educational training and drills, and school education on disaster prevention and reduction for in-depth understanding of the systems and institutions for this purpose. Next, Mr. Lin De-en, spoke on \"Climate Change Cross-Straight Forum\".  His speech began with the straight forum jointly held by both sides of the straight in 2009 and its significance as a platform for civilian communication on meteorology and disaster prevention. He then gave an example of how shared meteorological information was applied to slope disaster warnings and how early warning information on typhoons, monsoons and afternoon thundershowers could be used to take preventative measures. Multiple visits to China revealed the strengths of the other side of the straight to be aggressive in action, complete equipment, and excellence in fundamental theories and mathematical and scientific logic. Their weaknesses is the lack of scientific applications and hands-on experience. Lastly, he pointed out the close ties between the two sides of the straight in terms of meteorology and continued research on  disaster prevention meteorology and weather modification forward going.

At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The focus of the tour was the Jingliao community in Tainan and the tour was guided by local residents. Jingliao was the center connecting the north and south during the Qing Dynasty. Despite its decline due to changes over time, its rustic agricultural village culture have remained. In fact, the documentary \"Let It Be\" was filmed in Jingliao. The study tour began with an explanation of the origin of the name \"Wumile\", translated as \"let it be\", which is an allusion to the optimistic attitude of local old farmers toward life. During the tour of the rural community, the tour guide explained that, in the early days when resources are scarce, every household would grow fruits and vegetables in place of flowers for their values as decorative ornaments for the living environment as well as food for the family. A wide variety of fruit trees can still be seen in the community today. Upon arriving at Jingliao Old Street, the tour guide said that the street used to be the place to shop for wedding supplies. There was an old-fashion ice-cream shop where young men and women met on blind dates, and a shop where the bridal bedding sets could be customized. Everyone visited the shops and even saw the elaborate setting for weddings in early agricultural society where bridal dowry was loaded on an ox cart.

After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Climate change has caused turbulence in global weather. Therefore, safety standards should be raised at all levels, such as the seismic strength of buildings and safety factors for water conservancy projects. This month, Chairman Lin Chun-Hsing said that we are currently in the calm before the storm, and so we all ought to take a good rest to face more challenges ahead. The Archilife Headquarters will be inaugurated at the end of this year, and more conference venues are planned to facilitate discussions of more issues. Archilife's foundation change registration has also been settled, proving that \"true gold fears no fire\". As a reminder for all, we should have our feet planted on solid ground, do the right thing, and be discreet in our words and deeds.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Lin Fang-ming, presented a speech on the \"Domestic Timber Applied in the Development of Architecture and Craftsmanship\". The keynote speaker first explained that timber is a recyclable agricultural and forestry material that causes little pollution, while plants in plantations can absorb and store carbon dioxide, which is conducive to alleviating the greenhouse effect. The majority of timber currently in use in Taiwan is imported, and the self-sufficiency rate accounts for less than 1% of the total. The Forestry Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan has noted this phenomenon, and has promoted the use of domestic timber and the \"Taiwan Timber\" Mark in recent years. Smaller sizes of wood can still be used by gluing and finger jointing. The keynote speaker also shared with the participants architectural cases around the world, as well as household craft (furniture) production, and the use of Cryptomeria-like Taiwania in making violin panels, giving everyone a glimpse of the charms of domestic timber. Next, Mr. Lin De-en, spoke on \"Climate Change and Home Fengshui\". The keynote speaker first mentioned that disasters such as floods, typhoons and earthquakes taking place in various parts of the world threaten life and safety. Therefore, buildings in different localities come in many variations so as to best suit the local climate. Home Fengshui, such as \"situated in the north and facing the south\" (locations/directions), is indeed related to seasons and wind directions. Since wind is a determinant of temperature and humidity, \"small windows in the north and large windows in the south\" should be done to conform to seasonal changes and benefit human health. At last, the keynote speaker said that due to the drastically changing climate, it is only by monitoring the climatic changes as well as maintaining the utmost awareness of the importance of meteorological Fengshui can help mankind stand a better chance of survival. Next, Ms. Yen Hsiu-hui, spoke on \"A preliminary talk on cases of Recovery of Unlawful Interest from Environmental Pollution\". The keynote speaker first used the Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co's toxic edible oil case as an example. Since Change Chi is a corporate body, it could both be considered a criminal perpetrator that was found to have illegal income amounting to $1.8 billion was confiscated and a penalty of $38 million was issued; ASE Group Kaohsiung discharged wastewater containing heavy metals, but no penalty was issued by reason of nulla poena sine lege (principle of non-retroactivity of law). The Kaohsiung City Government eventually lost the case and returned $102 million. The R.O.C. Penal Code underwent confiscation system reform in 2015, and Water Pollution Control Act was amended into \"Illegal interests shall be recovered from offenders in addition to the fines issued\", explicitly stating the calculation and estimation details, thereby achieving the legislative role of sanctions, prevention, balancing unjust gains, and compensation. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation, and played a brainstorm game. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The June Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of June 9, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 12 ARF interns and their parents on an eco-tour to visit the place of origin of pineapples and discover rural art in Dashu. It was sunny on the day of tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning's itinerary brought everyone to Lin's Farm where a local resident acted as tour guide. She started by introducing the farm environment, explaining that the farm not only features dairy goat ecology but also the active restoration of the beetle population, giving the public a more diverse ecological experience. The guide also brought everyone to a group of Formosan Ash trees (Fraxinus griffithii) to observe the Japanese rhinoceros beetles (Allomyrina dichotoma). Next, everyone went to the goat barn where the guide introduced the species of dairy goat at the farm and their characteristics and habit, and the comparison of milk yield and quality. The guide gave everyone a taste of freshly drawn goat milk and explained the reason why most goat milk sold in the market taste \"goaty\". After leaving the farm, everyone took the bus to Longmu community for a delicious lunch of local specialties and a tour of the community. The guides explained that the water flowing in the ditches on the sides of the roads is from branches of the Gaoping River. To keep the river bed clean, drains are built on both sides of the river bed to separate river water and household sewage. Since ancient times, Longmu community has been known for the natural sweetness of its water and local residents still use water from the local mountain spring. The guide showed everyone the \"Longmu well\" which provided the main source of water to the village in the past. It remains an important landmark although water is no longer drawn here. When everyone walked past a brick-carved story wall, the guide said that the Dashu area is known for its kilning techniques. The brick carving on the wall was created using the \"carving before firing\" method to portray traditional farming life and religious festivals, and supplemented with the \"carving after firing\" method to display the diversity of the art. The final part of the tour was pineapple picking. The guide began by showing pictures of the stem, leaves, flower and fruit of the pineapple. She described the method of pineapple reproduction used by farmers, and how calcium carbide is used to induce flowering in pineapple, allowing it to be harvested any time of the year. Everyone began picking pineapples after learning how to pick them and determining if they are ripe. It was the first time the interns visited a pineapple field and they enjoyed themselves thoroughly. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The July Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on July 22, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Under the influence of climate change, the weather may change at any given moment. I hereby remind everyone to be prepared in advance for anything that may happen and \"assist others after you have assisted yourself\". I also want you all to complete trivia issues you have at hand and stock enough energy to face compound disasters. The Archlife NT Team has made conclusions in June and has handed over their progress to the Living Special Team for successive researches on issues caused by climate change in order to strengthen the livability of the Archlife Sub-Shield Center and make it a sound base for evacuation. In addition, the Archlife headquarter is scheduled to be operated by the end of this year. We expect that research agendas can receive swifter resolutions in this brand new office.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Lee Tzan-chain, presented a speech on the \"Precision Agriculture: Agriculture Combining Photobiology and Digital Technology\". The speaker first explained that photosynthesis is the most important response to activate life energy. Phytochrome through sunlight reflections will have different presentations under different climate and acidity environment. Through appliances that reflect the spectrum, we can detect the true color of plants more accurately. The speaker then explained the scope of application of NDVI and how it can distinguish normal and abnormal plant ranges. Currently, with the scanning and detection of appliances or unmanned drones, related data are being uploaded to the cloud. Finally, the speaker stated that precision agriculture can help us to quickly understand the adaptability of plants when facing climate change. If we can combine these data with climate information, we can even predict future annual production capacity as a reference for policy instructions and decision making. Next, Mr. Gao Chuan-chi, spoke on \"Chinese Pastry Culture under Climate Change\". The speaker first mentioned that diet habits have changed in different eras and nowadays we tend to have more contact with Western pastries. However, traditional Chinese pastry shops located in old downtown streets still play an important role in life rituals and festivals. Due to different cultural, there are different ways of eating. To seek its survival, old traditional pastry shops also collaborate and carry over innovation with Western pastry and even founded museums. The speaker then introduced featured pastry shops of different places and mentioned that under the stress of competition, they have updated and changed their packaging and taste. Currently, Chinese cuisine is not included in one of the 7 diet culture listed by UNESCO as a cultural heritage. In the future, we can start with education to allow such culture to be passed to the next generation. Next, Mr. Chou Yu-ching, spoke on \"Integration of the Hierarchy of Medical Care and Smart Medication\". The speaker first mentioned that the Smart Medication movement started due to excessive consumption of medical resources and The rate of medical disputes is also the highest in the world in USA, and earned a response from many developed countries in which they expect to achieve the professional purpose of appropriate medication. Taiwan should develop an effective collaboration network and medication suggestion to replace the current self-seeking medical treatment and multi-division diagnosis. The speaker also proposed a hierarchy of medical care and the implementation of two-way referrals. The speaker also reminded everyone to seek a familiar and trustworthy family doctor, do not seek medical treatment at more than 2 clinics or hospitals, and do not go to more than 3 permanent long-term chronic tracking clinics to achieve the purpose of smart medication. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The July Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of July 14, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 34 ARF interns and their parents on an eco-tour to experience music and explore aquaponics in Daxi, Taoyuan. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning's itinerary was a visit to Tong Ho Music Museum. At its eco-music zone, the tour guide explained that all musical instruments in that zone are made from scrap metal or recycled objects. Making use of the characteristics, length and height of different materials, sounds are created in more imaginative ways. By trying out the eco musical instruments, interns were able to observe each medium of sound transmission, and the relationship between length, tension and pitch. In the piano factory, the tour guide began by explaining that pianos in the factory are handmade. Each upright piano requires approximately three months to build. As everyone followed the flow of the production line, the tour guide explained the assembly process for a piano, and gave a brief introduction to one of the main components of the struck string system - the hammers. Once installation of the piano struck string system is complete, it will be tuned and the keystrokes tested. The piano keys will be activated by having them hit 750 times per minute. Everyone was amazed by the operation in the striking chamber. After lunch, in the piano dissection zone, the tour guide explained the principle behind how the piano makes sounds, and demonstrated the sound amplification function of the soundboard. The tour guide also explained the effect of string length and thickness on the pitch of the sounds, and that tuning is adjustment of string tension. In the sound experiential zone, which showcases a wide variety of musical instruments, including percussion instruments, electronic instruments and instruments that simulate sounds of nature, the tour guide described how the instruments are used and their sound-making principles, giving everyone a deeper impression of how the instruments work. The last part of the tour was a visit to Daxi Aquaponics Workshop. The farm owner began by explaining what is aquaponics and its operating principle, and then the group was divided into three teams for a guided tour and DIY activity. The farm owner introduced fruits and vegetables grown at the farm, and fishes reared, demonstrating the actual operation of aquaponics. Pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of aquaponics, he said that aquaponics is an environmentally friendly method to produce food but fruits and vegetables grown require iron spray due to yellowing caused by iron deficiency. Finally, the interns made their DIY aquaponics pots and experienced fishing with a net, thoroughly enjoying themselves. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The August Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on August 19, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"A major accident occurred in the collapse of the viaduct in Italy a few days ago. Remind everyone to pay attention to safety in your daily life, for example, you should walk in the arcade to avoid being smashed from peeling of the exterior wall of the building on the street. Another, Australia has experienced a severe rare drought for decades, when the water content in the atmosphere is too low, the vegetation will not grow up and desertification will occur, and the population may be forced to migrate. To guide everyone to continue to pay attention to the impact of climate change on the living environment, in this month, we will continue carrying out the \"Archilife Riddle Guessing\" title: \"What is the lowest humidity month and how much is the humidity %?\" Please take care of this topic and let the human living space have a better future.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Cheng Wei-ning, presented a speech on the \"2018 Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report\". The speaker first explained that the focus of this phase is on the study of the food supply program for asylum, and carries out the disaster situation analysis, sets the starting index of the evacuation center, and analyzes and calculates the personnel needs. Implementation processes include equipment tools and energy reserves, seeds, soil media and fertilizer reserves, and also training relevant operating manuals. However, the action plan of asylum stationed, including the action route planning and the life standard and action requirements during the period of asylum stationed. Currently, we are also continuing studying safety inspection and maintenance programs for buildings and living facilities. It is expected to achieve strengthening a link with the external symbiotic environment and maintaining the relationship with the living environment of the near settlements. Next, Mr. Lin Yu-yi, spoke on \"The practice of the development of Solar Photovoltaics of irrigating reservoir and pond\". The speaker first mentioned that since taking over Changhua Farm, it has turned a profit last year and it is actively creating a niche through land activation. Due to the problem of air pollution caused by thermal power generation, and in response to the promotion of the national green energy policy, the land available for Changhua Farm checked and the Xinpu irrigating reservoir and pond in Hsinchu area was selected, develop water-surface-type solar photovoltaics, the scale of setting is the first in the country. It is estimated that the economic output value of power generation will be more than NT$ 13 million per year, and the annual power generation capacity will be about 2.2 million kWh, which is enough to supply 920 households with electricity. In the future, various types of solar photovoltaics will be developed in various parts of Taiwan, and will expect to reduce carbon emissions and promote the development of related industries. Next, Mr. Tsai Kun-hsien, spoke on \"The Emerging Infectious Disease from Insect Vectors and Global Health and Epidemic Prevention\". The speaker first mentioned that global health due to climate change and transportation, infectious diseases has no longer borders. Of the infectious diseases, 70% belong to insect vectors or animal vectors, so it is the responsibility of everyone to do environmental maintenance. In the community activities, the speaker taught the general public to understand the environment and recognize the symptoms of dengue fever, and helped the general public to get medical treatment as soon as possible. However, the dengue fever epidemic is spreading in the north district of Taiwan. The speaker reminded everyone to spray qualified mosquito repellent liquid containing DEET when they are engaged in outdoor activities. The general public should cooperate with the government units to solve the problem together. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The August Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of August 18, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 16 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to discover eco glass and visit postwar relics in Kanglang, Hsinchu. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The first stop in the morning was Chi Sheng tour factory. Focusing on the human anatomy and the digestive system, the tour guide explained how food is digested and converted into nutrients by the various organs. Using an interactive screen, everyone also checked out their own color recognition ability and found out if they are at risk of macular degeneration. Next, with the drawings, the tour guide described the daily functioning of the human organs, and explained how to best combine daily activities and diet for the body. Leaving the tour factory, everyone made their way to Kangle community, and the tour was guided by the local resident. In the early days, it was called \"Kanglang Village\" due to the Kanglang trees (Phoenix loureiroi) flourishing in the area. It also has a pushcart train for transporting trade goods in the past. The interns toured the community in the handcar while the tour guide described the history of how the community's pioneers traveled across the sea to claim the land, and the origin and rebuilding of the railway of the handcar, leaving an impression on everyone. After lunch, during the tour of the community, the tour guide pointed out that the community became a shooting target for the US army during the Second World War as the Japanese army had built pillboxes there, leaving traces of the bullet holes on the walls till the present day. Next, everyone proceeded to the water well area, which was the source of domestic water supply in the early days. Still usable today, the tour guide taught everyone how to fetch water and the interns were eager to try. The end of the tour brought everyone to Spring Pool Glass Tourism Factory. Factory manager Mr. Wu, who acted as the tour guide, talked about Hsinchu's advantage in the development of the glass industry. He then explained that the factory had begun as a glass recycling factory, and it now uses its proprietary technology to turn recycled glass into artworks and building materials. He also showed the differences in the broken glass after it has been processed by grinding, melting, etc. In the workshop area, the interns had a general understanding of glass blowing by watching old master craftsmen at work. They then watched a video in a briefing room which described the history of the factory and examples of glass recycling and re-making. At the end of the video, the factory manager introduced their patented product\uff0drefractory brick, which was mentioned in the video. He even tested its fire resistance and sound proofing effects on site, and invited the interns to touch the brick. Everyone was amazed by its fire resistance and heat insulating effects. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The September Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2018 was held on September 16, 2018. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"US President Trump has re-launched NASA's space exploration mission and SpaceX has signed the world's first private passenger to fly around the Moon. These actions all coincide with the statement \"Leave the surface and travel among the stars\" of the Archilife Pioneer Team. We should keep on working hard to find the solution for human kind. In addition, given that we know life in an age with explosive amount of information, we should distinguish true and false information on the Internet with our knowledge and possess a strong mind and healthy body to confront those external challenges. This time, President Lin Chun-hsing reminds everyone to plan for the worst, assess things calmly and accept any possible outcome. Moreover, we should also accept the criticism and instruction from others humbly to seize the opportunity of becoming a better person.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Sun Ruei-suei presented a speech on the \"Why Do We Need Placemaking? Crisis, Policies and Case Studies\". The speaker first mentioned that Taiwan is now facing the crisis of low fertilization and an aging population. Then she spoke on the urban-rural gap due to the structure of the 6 metropolises, how to promote the self-efficiency on local economy, and the progress of innovative upgrade. Take Japan for example, it has stipulated national and local Comprehensive Placemaking Strategies and focused on the economic revitalization. The National Placemaking Strategy announced by Taiwan in 2018 focused on economic revitalization. Finally, the speaker mentioned that the different places of Taiwan should become \"creation bases\" and \"beautiful homelands\" in the future and we should invite the world to visit and understand Taiwan. Next, Mr. Li Shu-an spoke on \"An Introduction on the Environment Quality Monitoring Stations of Taichung\". The speaker first explained that monitoring data on air quality is an important basis for promoting air quality protection and operations preventing air pollution. Currently, Taichung has 11 automatic monitoring stations and 2 mobile air-quality monitoring vehicles. The Environment Protection Bureau has also built the latest version of \"Real-time Air Quality Information Site\" to provide citizens with the latest and most comprehensive air quality status. In addition, there are also 2 stationary noise monitoring stations and 22 mobile noise-monitoring stations. Finally, the speaker mentioned that the Environmental Protection Administration also launched the first app that provides 12-hour air quality prediction service using big data and AI, enabling citizens to retrieve information with greater convenience. Next, Ms. Yu Hsiu-yun spoke on \"International Exchanges and the Development of Higher Education\". The speaker first mentioned that in recent years, many foreigners have been invited to Taiwan to carry out international exchanges from different perspectives and cultures, such as the comparison of cross-strait Chinese literature courses, research on tea culture, cultural creative industry and their products, and so on. Besides, the speaker also went to China to take part in symposiums and cultural workshop camps. Besides comparing and understanding the trend of global higher education, she also observed climate change from the perspective of social science. The benefits of higher education for the nationals include high income, low crime rate and better quality of life. The speaker also mentioned Minerva School at KGI, one without classrooms and campus, as the new style for education institutes. Finally, the speaker believed that versatile perspectives can promote the competition and collaboration of global higher education and wanted us to be confident with the local education of Taiwan. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The September Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of September 15, 2018, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 26 ARF interns and their parents on an ecological tour to learn about owls and silkworms in Shihtan, Miaoli. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning's itinerary brought everyone to Owl Leisure Farm. Guided by the farm's owner, the tour began with a slideshow about the farm, which was established to rescue injured owls and other wild animals. The slideshow also introduced the types, characteristics and habits of owls, and explained that owls are considered protected birds of prey and should not be kept as pets. The guide also explained the reasons for the sharp decline in the number of owls\uff0dmainly due to the owls mistakenly entering bird netting installed for crop protection and getting injured or killed, and preying on small animals, such as mice, which have eaten pesticide contaminated crops. During the hike that followed, the guide reminded everyone that signs indicating wild animals along the way would allow them to observe the animals' path of movement. He also told a story about the Chinese box turtle (Cuora flavomarginata), correcting everyone's erroneous impression that it eats snakes, explaining its appearance and anatomy using a model, and teaching everyone how to identify its gender by the dent in its belly. As the Chinese box turtle is used as herbal tonic, it is highly demanded in the China tonic market, and poaching and smuggling are occasionally reported. It is hoped that everyone will learn the importance of wild animal conservation and Leave No Trace through the ecological tour. After lunch, everyone proceeded to a silkworm ecology farm. The guide began with a background introduction to the history of the silkworm industry in Taiwan. He then showed the paper on which the silkworm lays its eggs, explaining that it takes an average of 10 days for the eggs to hatch. As the eggs do not hatch easily in winter and quality of silk produced is poor, the eggs are normally refrigerated until the following spring or summer for hatching. During different stages of growth, the silkworm will eat mulberry leaves of different tenderness, sheds its skin and changes its body. The guide also clarifies that what is commonly thought to be where the silkworm's eyes are is actually the eye-shape pattern on its chest and its eyes are located on both sides at the top of its head (i.e. where it is commonly thought to be where the nose is). Finally, the guide explained the differences between the round cocoon and the flat cocoon. The former must be boiled to get the silk but the silk produced can become separated or tangled over time; the latter is having several silkworms weaving on a flat surface, which corrects the former's problem but is time consuming. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The October Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on October 20, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The Archilife Research Foundation was officially relocated to \"Chang\u2027An Building\" on September 3rd. We hope Archilife members will give us their suggestions and views based on their own experience, so as to perfect the \"Chang\u2027An Building\" space and further achieve the three elements contributing to longevity: \"healthy diet, healthy psychological state, and healthy space\". In addition, Archilife has been giving a lot of suggestions to the country. In particular, the circular economy-cradle to cradle (C2C) policy has been implemented by the Executive Yuan, and there are certification marks at present that ensure product supply chains, products themselves, and recycling and reuse methods are environmentally friendly, achieving biological cycle and industrial cycle and echoing Archilife\u2019s concept of a symbiotic cycle.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Wang Wen-an, presented a speech on the \"The reproduction of the beauty of campus natural environment by mountaintops and sea cliffs\". The presenter first said through the Mid- and Long-term Education Plan of the Ministry of Education, children can have an aesthetic sense, which is the basic ability covering knowledge, skills, and habits throughout the course of individuals\u2019 communication with the outside, enabling them to detect the uniqueness of space. The presenter further used a school in Lishan, Taichung as an example. The school is located at an altitude of 2012 meters. Due to transportation inaccessibility, construction involved a certain degree of difficulty. However, after overcoming the problems faced, the school\u2019s features coupled with the local environment made it a venue accommodating more aesthetic education activities. We expect aesthetic education to continue to be cultivated for future generations to prefect the aesthetic education support system, deepen the academic and practical development of aesthetic education, improve the aesthetic sense, promote aesthetics in campuses and community spaces, and enhance national competitiveness in aesthetics. Next, Mr. Lin Chih-yuan spoke on \"Sharing of Local Creation Cases in Hsinchu County\". The presenter first explained \"local creation\" that originated in Japan. Its central idea is the trinity of \"production, place, people\", which is intended for localities to combine their geographical characteristics and cultures and customs for urban and rural areas to develop suitable industries. The presenter first used Wufeng Township, Hsinchu as an example, building a livable, home-based, and livelihood-based local creation circle, revitalizing the local economy, and constructing a livable environment. He went on citing Guanxi Township as an example, carrying out the \"old town; new city\" creation plan, the traditional industry\u2019s use of new business modes and sales approaches, reinterpreting and developing grass jelly, tea production, and other innovative business models. In the future, we hope the government will continue to coordinate and integrate ministries and localities for creation related resources, implement and promote local creation work, and gradually promote immigration within the island, and carry out stress reduction in conjunction with capital ring stress reduction, thereby achieving the goal of \"balanced development in Taiwan\". Next, Mr. Lin De-en spoke on \"Hope of Change\uff0dA Talk on Climate Change and Environmental Education Promotion\". The presenter first said that data have shown extreme climate accompanying climate change has become more intense than ever, thus the great importance of down rooting education. The presenter went on about the current educational work undertaken by the Hsinchu Education Group. Through experiments, verifications, visitations, and exchanges, young students are imparted with knowledge of the threats and the impact of climate change on the environment in all parts of the world, eliciting their sense of responsibility for the love of earth based on their knowledge of extreme climate. Finally, the presenter mentioned sentimentally: \"In life, we constantly pursue our goals. While doing so, we may also be destroying the surrounding environment without knowing it. I hope everyone will make an effort for others to understand climate change and the importance of earth protection.\" After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The October Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of October 19, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 10 ARF interns and their parents to the northeast coast to learn about marine ecology and rustic fishing village. It was rainy on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Centering on the northeast coast, the study tour was guided by Mr. Wu Wen-yih, chief of the local Fulian village. The tour began with a visit to New Taipei City Maritime Resources Recovery Park. Mr. Wu said there used to be a booming industry for the farming of the variously colored abalone in Maoao Bay. However, due to weakened immunity from prolonged inbreeding and the import of low-cost Chinese small abalone which were later found to carry diseases, the industry was almost entirely destroyed. Everyone watched a video introducing the environmental resources around Maoao Bay, the rise and fall of the small abalone farming industry in the Gongliao area and updates on small abalone restoration. Using aerial photos of Maoao Bay, Mr. Wu explained Maoao Bay's superior geographical position and diverse marine environment. To deepen the emotional connection between children and the ocean, marine education engaging the local industries and environment is integrated into the local elementary school curriculum. Besides learning about small abalone farming, diving and ocean swimming, students can only graduate after having swum across the Maoao Bay, released small abalone seeds underwater and dived to the ocean bed to retrieve their graduation certificates. During the tour of the nursery, Mr. Wu explained the internal characteristics of marine organisms and encouraged the interns to get to know these organisms by touching them, thus cultivating their concept of marine conservation. After lunch, everyone took the footpath to Sandiao Cape Lighthouse. At the top of the lighthouse, Mr. Wu pointed out Maoao Bay along the winding coastal line and said there are three probable reasons for the name of the bay. Firstly, the bay looks like the Chinese character for \"mao\" from a bird's eye perspective. Secondly, the character \"mao\" which means five to seven o'clock in the morning refers to the time the village fishermen go out to sea. Thirdly, the name implies \"making big bucks\" in Taiwanese as fishermen earned a lot of money from the bounteous ocean catch in the early days. In the next part of the itinerary, everyone visited ancient stone houses. In the past, before the northern coastal road was open, residents mostly used locally found materials, such as coastal sandstone and reef, to build houses by laying or stacking these materials. A house owner's economic status can be seen from the method and refinement of the stone-laying. The walls of the stone houses may be laid using the horizontal angle method, 45-degree-angle method and random laying method. To adopt the horizontal angle method, builders must polish and straighten the stones, making it highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, and is usually adopted by the wealthy. During the entire tour, Mr. Wu was humorous and friendly, and interacted well with the interns. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The November Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on November 24, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The new form of \"Bookish Assembly 2.0\" has officially started on September 10. With improving bookish assembly by deepening their value as the target, its emphasis is on \"specialization\", \"general knowledge\" and \"collective wisdom\". It trains everyone to precisely express their opinion within 1.5 minutes and continues to lead us to the field of all-knowing. On the other hand, due to global disasters and turbulent politics, we should seek our positioning under such scenario, contribute our efforts for Taiwan, and practice Archilife ideas in different fields for the sustainable survival of mankind. Finally, I remind everyone that trails will be left wherever you walk, so we should be prudent on our actions and stay a low profile.\" Later on, the three new knowledge keepers took turns to introduce themselves to the members.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Hung Chi-tung, presented a speech on the \"The Rise of All-disaster Disaster Reduction Risk Assessment Structure Corresponding with Climate Change: Case Study of Hsinchu\". The speaker first mentioned that, due to the influence on environments from climate change, governments have successively proposed corresponding disaster reduction adjustment strategies. However, when examining the urban plan of Zhubei City, it changed agricultural lands that serve reduction and adjustment functions. The rolling urban governance of Zhubei City also resulted in fragile urban land and unbalance on regional development. Therefore, the government should take climate change and the reduction and adjustment of land usage change into consideration in order to establish an appropriate system under the direction of all-disaster management planning and adjustment strategy. By doing so, definite and sufficient resources can be provided to support disaster reduction, disaster prevention and drills, and other potential disaster scenario operations. With land usage planning as tool of disaster prevention and adjustment, we can reduce the pressure of disaster corresponding and achieve all-disaster management and sustainably resilience. Next, Mr. Wu Gan-li spoke on \"Research on the Natural Ventilation Strategy and Design Principals of Minnan Traditional Settlements at Hot and Humid Climate Regions\". The speaker first mentioned that he researched the external space and ventilation environment of 10 classical traditional Minnan settlement buildings in Kinmen. With the integration and application of multi-dimensional simulation analysis, along with the combination of planning design and land development control, to promote the sustainable development of Minnan-style settlement buildings in Kinmen and enhance the comfort level of the residents\u2019 external space. The lecturer also carried out CFD simulation, analysis and comparison on the outdoor ventilation environment of Kinmen settlements and proposed 4 solutions: enlarge ventilation openings, prevent wind inflow, adjust the facing of buildings, and enhance ventilation corridors. By doing so, it expects to achieve the win-win situation of environment improvement and settlement preservation. Next, Mr. Li Yen-yi spoke on \"Asian Climate and Urban Development\". The speaker first mentioned the increase of CO2 that resulted in global warming, the prolonging of the summer and dry season, and further caused sea level rise. Crises also included wild fires around the world that also affected human health. The speaker then mentioned the decrease of light rain days in Taiwan that caused withered plants and dust pollution. According to statistics, 7 out of the 10 countries that suffered the greatest risk due to climate change and natural disasters are in Asia. Under the high temperature of urban environment, one of the most obvious issues is how to plant enough plants to provide sufficient water for climate adjustment. The speaker also brought up the climate adjustment strategy of Hamburg, Germany as an example and further discussed the holistic core planning ideas of Kaohsiung on climate, expecting to correspond with climate change while promoting sustainable development. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Later on, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying announced the answer of 2018 \"Archilife Riddle Guess\". The month with the highest temperature in Taipei City was 37.8\u2103 in August. She then presented intern Mr. Chang Tzu-yu with the present of a 6-in-1 environment detector. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The November Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of November 16, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 12 ARF interns and their parents to learn about the development of bicycles and enjoy a LOHAS trip in Taoyuan. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The morning's itinerary was a bicycle trip at Xinwu Green Tunnel. Xinwu covers a vast area. In the early days, due to strategic considerations, the military constructed a road for defense purpose and planted coastal plants on both sides of the road to cover the army's track. As the tension between Taiwan and China eases, the Green Tunnel has been converted for tourism use. Led by the staff of Pacific Cycles Museum, the morning began with a round trip to Yongan Fishing Port. The tour guide introduced Xinwu's ocean view and pointed out the stone weirs known as the \"Great Wall of the Sea\". The stone weirs are ancient tidal fish traps. Fishermen would build stone walls by stacking rocks in the intertidal zone. During high tides, fish would swim in along with the seawater and when the tide went out, the fish would get trapped within the walls as the walls were higher than sea level. In the early days, locals depending on the sea for their livelihood had to manually move cobblestones to build hundreds, even thousands, of meters of stone walls. A single stone weir would require the labor of a whole village. Not only does it show the pioneers' wisdom and teamwork, it is also evident of the interdependent relationship between mankind and nature. After lunch, everyone went to visit the Pacific Cycles Museum. Before the tour began, everyone watched a film introducing the purpose and characteristics of the museum. After watching the film, the tour guide explained the difference between the large wheel diameter and small wheel diameter \u2013 small one requires less driving force and makes riding easier while large one may initially requires more effort because of more driving force required but once it builds up momentum it becomes easier to ride than the smaller one. On an upward slope, small wheel diameter is easier because large one will not be able to achieve momentum. However, due to the small wheel diameter, the distance traveled per revolution will be shorter. After introduction, everyone was able to try riding different bicycles, some of which are built for specific users. During the experience, everyone learned the main purpose of different bicycle types. For instance, hand-cycles are designed for people with disabilities who have difficulty engaging in outdoor activities. The collection in the museum are bicycles of different designs, which show the evolution and changes in functionality of bicycles over time. Initially designed as a simple form of transport, it has now become a trendy recreational sport, and a part of the government's effort to conserve energy and reduce carbon footprint. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The December Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on December 15, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The global situation has been turbulent in recent years, and natural disasters and human calamities continue to take place. I would like to hereby reiterate President Lin Chun-shin\u2019s announcement in 2019 : \"The forecasted situation has emerged, the black swans are waiting in line to prepare for the show. The opportunity is to be grasped, the crisis should be avoided.\", reminded everyone to make correct judgement and develop extraordinary powers to pass the harsh tests ahead. In addition, Archilife and the TSSBE members hosted a banquet at the Sheraton Taipei Hotel on December 10th to welcome iiSBE CEO Nils Larsson who came for a visit. Mr. Nils Larsson highly rated Taiwan\u2019s efforts in promoting a sustainable environment and forward-looking vision and said he would support Taiwan through action. The members also showed their foreign language skills. During the banquet, the atmosphere was warm, and both the guests and hosts thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Finally, let me remind you all that in 2020 we shall continue to speak and act cautiously with a conservative approach.\" Later on, the new knowledge keeper introduced herself to the members.  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Chang Yu-tung, presented a speech on the \"Recreating the Historical Scene-Exemplified by the Syongjhen North Gate and Zhuoying Fengshan Jiou-Cheng West Gate Tie Gong Section\". The presenter first said \"Preservation\" is not just restoration but an interpretation and recreation of historical scenarios. Recreating the Historical Scene is a new cultural asset strategy proposed by the Ministry of Culture on June 17th, 2016, which starts from the perspective of history and cultural memory, incorporates city governance and create memories that reconnect with modern life. The presenter used the British consulate as an example. After collecting and compiling information and relevant investigations and research, planning design and restoration works commenced, hoping to preserve and continue the spirit of the place. She subsequently mentioned the geographical location and historical background of the Syongjhen North Gate. The goal of the restoration was to display the original battery space and establish links with the first port space. For the Zhuoying Fengshan Jiou-Cheng West Gate part, we hope that the historical features of the Jiu-Cheng Ximen site can be fully constructed. Next, Ms. Su Mei-ju spoke on \"The Impact of Policy on Museum Development\". The presenter first said that Taiwan\u2019s museum business is currently in an era of diversification. In the wake of all walks of life, the Museum Act was promulgated in 2015. Under the Museum Act, the museums have the status of non-profit organizations, and natural persons have the right to apply for museum setup, which are conducive to encourage private museum establishment. The presenter also mentioned the content of the museum and local culture development plan promoted from 2016 to 2021 and shared the Lanyang Museum case with all, hoping that through the laws and regulations, the constitution of museums can be improved, thereby perfecting museum functions and winning the support and participation of the general public. Through the development plan, the sustainable management and development of local cultural undertakings can be promoted. Next, Mr. Chen Yuan-hung spoke on \"Description of Critical Age and Earthquake Residence\". The presenter first mentioned that Taiwan is located along the Pacific Rim seismic belt, with an average of thousands of earthquakes each year. The building load transfer path is from slabs, beams, the columns. Therefore, slabs must have enough strength and stiffness to carry the loads of furniture, equipment, and people. The presenter explained PSERCB operating procedures, while data can also be applied in future disaster prevention, policy formulation, and urban renewal. There are various construction methods for reinforcing the earthquake resistance of buildings, which should fully consider the building use needs. Today\u2019s seismic force computation is also included in the critical-age building focuses. The presenter also said that under Taiwan\u2019s environment of frequent earthquakes, old buildings have inadequate earthquake resistance. Therefore, the crucial age ordinance has been set up to enhance the home safety of citizens. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The December Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of December 14, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 10 ARF interns and their parents to Gala-a to experience the daily life in old Taipei. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Led by Mr. Gao Chuan-chi, the focus of the study tour was southern Wanhua district. The first stop of the tour was Bangka Lungshan Temple. Mr. Gao began by introducing the temple's couplet poems and architectural style. He said many miracles had made Lungshan Temple the center of religious faith in the locality. Despite many reconstructions and repairs, its importance remains unshakable in local residents' mind. For instance, during the Second World War, if there was an air raid, residents would usually seek refuge under the statue of the Bodhisattva in the main temple hall. In one particular instance, on the day before the US army bombed old Taipei City, residents went back to their own homes because of mosquitoes and thus narrowly escaped death when the main temple hall was destroyed by bomb. The next stop of the tour was the garment wholesale street on Xiyuan Road. With the rising demand for clothing due to postwar baby boom and women joining the workforce, and emergence of the \"ready-to-wear\" concept, garment stores started sprouting up and forming its own business district. In its hay days, throngs of customers visited the stores and store owners often fell asleep in the midst of counting their money past midnight. After the 1980s, there was a mass exodus of garment and textile factories overseas. The slump in domestic demand has caused the decline in the business district, making the issue of transforming the business worth pondering. As everyone arrived at park number 411, Mr. Gao explained that it was used to manufacture light aircraft during the Japanese Occupation. Trees and bamboo plants were planted in the surrounding area, and air raid shelter was constructed, to provide military defense. Over the past several decades, the park was established in the effort to preserve cultural assets and the natural landscape. Instead of the trees providing coverage for the air raid shelter and the air raid shelter protecting people, the situation is now whereby people are preserving the air raid shelter and thus protecting the old trees rooted in the air raid shelter. After lunch, Mr. Gao said that southern Wanhua district was originally known as \"Gala-a\". Before the Han Chinese settled into the area, it was inhabited by the Pingpu people. The name \"Gala-a\" in Ketagalan language means swamp as many waterways cut across the area in the early days. The winding roads seen today were in fact the paths of ancient rivers. The next stop of the tour was the Youth Park, which was formerly Taiwan's earliest military airport. As opposed to Songshan Airport in the northern end, it was known as the South Airport, which is the name given for the area surrounding the Youth Park today. After its transformation into a park, the combination of local culture and recreational sports has gradually changed the lifestyle of the southern Wanhua residents. At the end of the tour, everyone visited the Wanhua Story House inside the park. Through the exhibition of old photos, historical data and video information, everyone had a deep understanding of the changes in southern Wanhua through the times and interesting facts about local customs. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The January Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on January 20, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Climate change is currently a hotly discussed topic worldwide, while Archilife proposed a study on climate variability more than 20 years ago, it is believed that \"change\" is not good enough to describe the phenomenon of extreme weather impacts, and now refers to it as \"variation\". In addition, the lowest humidity at 26% was in March, 2018; the low humidity will lead to severe temperature differences that cause impacts on the ecological environment. The headquarter of Archilife is scheduled to be open in the second half of this year and it's expected that more variety of discussions about different issues will proceed in the brand-new space. Besides, differing from the \"virtual\" trends on the Internet, Archilife's adoption of \"real\" symbiotic digital civilization and emphasis on having clear concepts before carrying out relevant promotions are expected to continue and convey the philosophy of Archilife.\" Afterward, the new knowledge keeper was introduced, Ms. Wu Ying-jen, the meteorology keeper, formally joined the foundation. Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chen Chih-chen gave a presentation on \"Local Observation on Regional Characteristics and the Environmental Quality of Urban Life- from Yuanzilin to Yuanlin City\". First, the speaker first shows the relative position of the Yuanlin City on the map. After the railway tracks elevation in downtown Yuanlin City, the traffic flow on external roads stopped by railway has been improved. The additional residential area created by Yuanlin Land Consolidation in the area of 184 hectares has driven facilities in the surrounding, including disaster prevention, catering, and public facilities. Then, the speaker mentioned that the attention will also be paid to the changes of collective residence or independent living space in Yuanlin City in the future as well as the space planning in front of the train station in the hope to solve the parking demands and take the beautiful scenery of greenery into account at the same time. The speaker indicated the expectation that all corners of Taiwan will develop regional characteristics that further improve the quality of life. Next, Mr. Li Hung-chien, spoke on \"Sustainable environment- Regarding the Predicament and Solution Strategy of Urban Renewal\". First, the speaker indicated that there are more than 90 thousand buildings in Taipei City built more than 30 years ago. In response to the advent of an aging society, urban renewal is imperative. However, urban renewal is facing many dilemmas, including complex ownership and not easy to integrate the opinions of landowners and titleholders; difficulty in promotion due to a small number of objections; asymmetric information resulting in insufficient mutual trust between the implementers and landowners; lengthy reviewing process for government-led urban renewal; and independence of real estate valuation. At present, the responding solution strategies are proposed: enhancement of the inducement and strengthening the coercive force; the effective solution to the households that do not consent; and improvement of deliberation efficiency. It's hoped that with the regeneration and activation of land resources through urban renewal, environmental sustainability will be achieved. Next, Mr. Wu Gan-li, spoke on \"Architecture and Urban Design Responding to the Windy Environment\". First, the speaker mentioned that natural ventilation can slow down the heat island effect and improve air quality so as to improve space comfort and public health. Through field investigation, micro-climate measurement, a survey of comfort in the windy environment, and CFD simulation, as well as any other analysis after the comprehensive application it has developed a set of building evaluation models suitable for the concept of natural ventilation. The speaker cited the architectural patterns of each region that were in line with nature are the evidence of ecological intelligence of the buildings in the area. The speaker indicated that the maneuverability of the windy environment has been confirmed in the course of the study, so as to assist in the planning of residential quarters and the decision of external space design. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed their opinions and views during thepiggy hour. The January Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of January 12, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 13 ARF interns and their parents on a tour to learn about taro and Hakka culture in Golden Town, Miaoli. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. Focusing on the Golden Town Leisure Agricultural Area, the tour was guided by a committee member of the community development association. The tour guide began by explaining that the Golden Town owes its name to the vast sea of golden yellow created by the vibrant clusters of golden shower flowers that bloom from May to July every year and the undulating yellow rice paddies. He then introduced the extent of the agricultural area, its geographical environment, specialty industries and main crops, explaining that local climate, water quality and soil are suitable for growing crops, especially red dates, and it is the only place in Taiwan that produces red dates. It also produces many types of farm products, offering a variety of landscapes all year round. What followed was a bicycle trip around the agricultural area to discover Hakka culture and farm scenery. After lunch, the tour guide said that Gongguan, Miaoli, is the second largest taro producing area after Pingdung in Taiwan. However, as the taros grown in the area were mostly sold as Dajia taro after purchase by wholesalers, many people have not heard of Gongguan taro. Through the combination of industry and recreational tourism, it is hoped that more people will learn about the local taros. The tour guide also introduced an important ingredient in Hakka pickle - \"fucai\", which is pickled mustard that is torn into long strips, salted and sun-dried, and sealed in a glass container or jar while still moist for three to six months. \"Meigancai\", on the other hand, is made by sun-drying the leaves left over from making \"fucai\" until completely dried for longer storage. Everyone then tried pressing pickled mustard that is 60-70% dried into a jar using a round-ended rod, squeezing out any air and pouring out excess water, and finally sealing the jar. The final part of the tour was taro picking. The tour guide explained that taro is an annual plant, growing up to 200 centimeters around July or August. Its leaves wilt and the plant becomes shorter in autumn as the nutrients are absorbed by its corm. Everyone was taught how to determine if the taro was ripe and how to harvest it. The interns enjoyed harvesting the taro as it was their first time. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The March Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on March 17, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"I believe everyone still remembers the annual announcement made by President Lin Chun-shin reminding us that: \"The forecasted situation has emerged, the black swans are waiting in line to prepare for the show. The opportunity is to be grasped, the crisis should be avoided.\" under the influence of natural and man-made disasters, we should take more conservative principles and know how to steer away from bad things. Moreover, now that fake news and internet rumors are everywhere, we should be careful about their authenticity before propagating them and not spread fake information to make this country and society peaceful. Therefore, we encourage all to participate more at our bookish assembly so you would have enough knowledge to make a correct judgment.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Yang Cheng-fan spoke on \"The Current Situation of Cell Treatment Technology in Taiwan\". The speaker first talked about financial status of national health insurance. In recent years, expenditure has increased due to new drugs, new specialties, and chronic diseases and cancer medical expenses, in which the National Health Insurance Administration responded to it by reducing outpatients by 2% and cancelled the benefit of various kinds of medicines. The speaker then mentioned an American case in which mesenchymal stem cell was injected into cartilage and enabled the latter to proliferate by 15%, a treatment that is not available yet in Taiwan. Stem cells can be categorized into embryonic stem cell and somatic stem cell. The lecturer also talked about clinical experiment cases on hESC age-related macular degeneration treatment and Japan iPS at various universities, indicating that while researches on stem cell are thriving oversea, Taiwan has not showed any progress yet. The speaker then mentioned that cell treatment has a high threshold and hard-to-certificate field, which makes it an appropriate topic for Taiwan's development for the next generation. Next, Mr. Day Yeong-tyi spoke on \"Livelihood Co-creation: Experiential Learning of Agricultural Village Service Learning\". The speaker first mentioned that the agricultural village reformation project carried out by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau is implemented with community building method in order for students to obtain knowledge and accumulate experience through service learning. The teaching at aborigine classes stressed the physical practice and memory. In order to effectively utilize limited resources, students from different grades were taught together. They cooperated with tribes and took students there. The presenter also shared a wealth of illustrations to give participants a better understanding of the process. The speaker also mentioned that one of the important tasks in the livelihood of traditional tribes is to rebuild the millet system with the expectation of creating economic, social and ecological transformation to the aborigine's degenerating agricultural village system. It also seeks to duplicate its past progress and promote a more ideal tribal life. Next, Ms. Yeh Jiuan-reng spoke on \"Forward-looking Urban and Rural Cultural Living Circle Building Project on Re-constructing the Musical History of Taiwan: Digitalization and Construction of Circular Cultural Environment\".The speaker first mentioned that this is a part of the basic design of the Executive Yuan. The circular cultural environment construction of Taiwan's musical history includes archive collection, research, publication and  performance. Regarding digitalization, the Taiwan Music Information Exchange Platform Database, the Online Database of Taiwanese Musicians, Traditional and Folk Instrument Database and other websites have been constructed in 2011. The online virtual exhibition hall of Taiwan Music Institute has been constructed in 2017 and its Music Culture Map website has been opened on March 2019. The speaker mentioned that 10 performances on different ethnic groups had taken place at various locations in 2018. She expected that through the implementation of such plan, the beautiful sounds of Taiwan can be preserved. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The March Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of March 16, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 24 ARF interns and their parents on a tour of old railroad track and learned about organic food and farming in Miaoli. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The morning's itinerary began with a ride on Miaoli's old mountain line rail bike. After a video explanation of the safety precautions and steering guidelines, everyone cycled to and back from Liyutan Dam, passing Longteng Bridge and Yutengping Iron Railway Bridge, and enjoyed beautiful scenery of the mountain town and appreciated the craftsmanship of early railway from different angles. Back at Longteng Bridge after the ride, chief executive of the local development association, Mr. Chen Chunghe, introduced Miaoli as the only county city in Taiwan with two international \"slow city\" certifications. Recently, the operation of the old mountain line rail bike has helped the public deepen its impression of Sanyi railway culture. The tour guide, Mr. Chen, also talked about the history and value of Longteng Bridge, which is left with only six abutments at the northern end and four abutments at the southern end, and some damaged abutments, after surviving the Shinchiku-Taichu earthquake in 1935 and Chichi earthquake in 1999. Walking to the south end of the bridge, everyone saw the unique scenery of a red fruit fig tree entwining the brick-built bridge, which is an ingenious combination of manmade structure and nature. However, the entwining roots are unfavorable for preservation of the abutments in the long term. Thus, the urgent issue is how to protect the bridge. After an organic lunch at Huixiang Organic Farm, the tour guides brought everyone on a tour of the farm and explained that the farm practices ecological farming method. It does not use any pesticide, herbicide or chemical fertilizer, and advocates cultivating plants with unique scents to ward off pests, for example, planting spring onion in the strawberry field, and making use of feeding relationships in the food chain to reduce pests such as ladybugs eat aphids. To control weed, vegetables are grown together with weed plants. If weed plants grow too high, they are cut off without uprooting so as to prevent aggressive weed species from damaging the farmland's ecological balance, and the cut off weed plants are used as soil compost. The farm also has an area where flowering plants are grown and an ecological pond is dug out to provide habitat for insects and to lower the surrounding temperature. In the carrot field, everyone had fun harvesting and tasting freshly plucked and washed carrots. At the end of the tour, the interns tried their hands at DIY tofu for the first time, and felt truly accomplished after completing the pulping, washing and curd making. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The April Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on April 28, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"In view of the sharp temperature rise trend, this year may be the turning point, transitioning from the drastic climate into desertification. In this regard, President Lin Chun-hsing once again gave a warning to the Archilife Research Foundation members, reminding everyone to take caution in a conservative fashion. In addition, the temperature difference also poses a major impact on plant growth and human health. Hence, the theme question for the \"Archilife Riddle Guess\" this month, will be \"During which week does the greatest temperature change in Taipei City occur?\" This question is intended to remind everyone to take note of climate change. I am pleased with the resolution reached by the Taiwan Society of Sustainable Built Environment, TSSBE yesterday regarding Mr. Wang Wen-an\u2019s succession as the Chairman. In the future, Taiwan\u2019s sustainable building and environment related academic and practical international exchanges will continue to be promoted. I hope that the members with expertise in their respective fields will continue to voice out their contributions internationally.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Cheng Wei-ning spoke on \"Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report for the Second Half of 2018\". The presenter first said that the focus at this stage was whether or not the Archilife Sub-shield Center, faced with intense heat and extreme events, had all the conditioning necessary. The team members based their judgement of the increasingly severe climate change  while monitoring the current situation of the Archilife Sub-shield Center, leading to the proposal of three major research issues: anti-heat and disaster prevention response plans, hygiene and health promotion plans, and water sources management coping strategic plans. Since Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on four sides, the \"constant temperature effect\" results, the impacts of heat and water sources are relatively negligible, while the counter-epidemic disease is a prioritized target. In the future, infectious diseases should be monitored, epidemic development be estimated, and counter responses be performed, including practices expected by the Archilife Sub-shield Center, thereby ensuring the wellbeing of the population. Next, Mr. Hung Chi-tung spoke on \"Resilient Taiwan Moving towards Sustainable Development: Borrowing the Example of Post-disaster Reconstruction of the Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic Area\". The presenter first stated that the local socioeconomic vulnerability overly relied on \"scenic area development\", thus resulting in the worsening dependence on scenic areas and the lack of independent socioeconomic orientation. Jiuzhaigou\u2019s industrial reconstruction involves a greater degree of difficulty compared to that of Wenchuan or Lushan, but the reconstruction plan continues to deepen the dependence on the tourism industry but ignores the risks. The presenter said that cross-domain discipline management, the integration of disaster system structure and function, and the clarification of tourism policies are the keys to reconstruction. The presenter also put forth a new type of resilience and sustainable planning strategy, specifically responses for region-based local natural disasters, coping strategies for the local and central governments, the local residents, and tourists, risk communication, and other environmental ethics and disaster awareness related education for all. Next, Mr. Lin De-en spoke on \"Economic Activities Under Climate Change\". The presenter first said that if the pulse of climate change can be grasped, wealth and health can be enhanced. The presenter cited examples and gave explanations, such as a mild winter will cause winter clothes to be unsellable, typhoon information will help stores stock up on food for sale, and knowledge of the microclimate for the day will help in planning the lighting for ball courts. The presenter said with this year\u2019s warm season was dry with uneven heavy rainfall distribution, huge disasters brought by heavy rainfall and relatively high temperatures following the dry season must be noted. With the overall high temperatures, how to lower temperatures and fight the heat will remain the greatest challenge. Meanwhile, the typhoons and severe rainfall will also strengthen in terms of intensity. The presenter gave a reminder to everyone that the climate fluctuations have intensified over the past two decades. In addition to the economic impacts, they will also pose a more serious threat to the safety and lives of people. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The April Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of April 20, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 28 ARF interns and their parents on a tour of Fangyuan aquaculture farm in Changhua and experienced a day as a fisher. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The morning's itinerary brought everyone to Haha Fish Farm in Fangyuan, Changhua. The fish farm believes that seafood grown in a natural ecological environment is the most delicious. By allowing diverse species of organisms to co-exist and reproduce naturally, ecological balance is achieved as the fittest that survive will be the strongest and healthiest. On this tour, the farm owner Mr. Chen Ming-liao was the tour guide. He began the tour by introducing everyone to the river-mouth ecosystem, explaining that water for the fish farm comes from the sea. The cleanliness of water is determined by survival of fish and shrimps at the river mouth. He also used cast net and fishing net trap to catch fishes, enabling everyone to witness the biodiversity of the river-mouth ecosystem. He then explained how the fishing net trap is used and the principle behind it. He also gave a step-by-step demonstration of casting the fishing net and encouraged the interns to try it out to experience using the important tool fishermen depend on for their livelihood in the past. Next everyone wore wading pants and tried out the traditional fishing method of using Taiwanese beach seine. Divided into two groups, everyone stood on one or the other side of a large fishing net and worked together to drag the net back onto the shore when the bamboo raft had driven the fishes into the net, experiencing the team spirit of fishermen in the past. Lunch was the fresh and delicious fish caught by everyone in the morning. After lunch, the tour guide explained how female shrimps carry their eggs and their physiological changes during reproduction before bringing everyone to Hanbao Wetland to learn about intertidal living things. The interns looked for sand crabs using shovels and observe their characteristics up close. Next, the tour guide introduced the oyster field and parasitic organisms, pointing out that oysters are filter feeders which can purify water and their shells can convert carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate, which is highly efficient in carbon sequestration. Moreover, oyster reefs are natural coastal buffers, providing bottom dwellers habitat and refuge. The tour guide added that rearing oysters along coastal areas where the shoreline is level, continental shelf is gently sloping, and there is great rise and fall in the tides, will provide oysters with adequate nutrients. Due to the great temperature difference between the seawater and land, the oysters will work hard to release massive amount of sperms or eggs for reproduction when they detect sudden temperature changes as it is perceived as a threat to their survival. The tour guide then concluded by comparing the differences in oyster farming between Changhua/ Yunlin and Chiayi/ Tainan. The entire day has been filled with exciting activities and lively content, getting enthusiastic response from the interns.  At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The May Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on May 26, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The global situation has recently become plagued with uncertainty. In addition to the intensification of the US-China trade war, the U.S. also imposed bans on the sale and purchase of Huawei products. The effect on the global economy has been profound. Everyone should therefore think carefully before they invest to avoid getting caught up in the storm. All Archilife members have a wealth resources, with most being \"Giver\" that enjoy sharing. We therefore have the power to help other people so we hope that everyone can uphold the Archilife spirit of giving in promoting social progress and development. The Archilife Book Assembly has been in operation for twenty years. Many Archilife members have now acquired sufficient social experience and status. For this reason, those that pass a special review by Archilife can be appointed as knowledge keepers so that knowledge can be shared on more diverse levels.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Wang Min-chou spoke on \"Challenges facing nuclear energy in Taiwan after the referendum\". The presenter began by listing the challenges facing nuclear energy in the wake of the referendum on \"using nuclear to nourish renewables\" being passed. Nuclear Reactors No.1 and No.2 have both exceeded their application deadline for service life extensions, the difficulty of securing permission to construct dry storage facilities for Nuclear Reactor No.3, and the many obstacles in the way of re-commissioning Nuclear Reactor No.4. Challenges facing policy development include complex policy issues, inadequate information, narrow or simplistic interpretation, and a lack of public trust. It may be possible to resolve these problems through disclosure, inventory of disputes and communication. As Taiwan is now at the crossroads of change, the presenter suggested that concepts such as a contraction in the material civilization and expansion of the spiritual civilization can be introduced to the sustainability policies of Taiwan. The answers may very well present themselves once the right direction is found. Next, Mr. Lin Fang-ming spoke on \"Recycling of secondary materials in agriculture and forestry\". The presenter started by mentioning how 2017 was declared \"Year One of Locally-Produced Wood\" by the Forestry Bureau as part of the campaign to revitalize the plantation industry. Trees absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide and the wood itself can be reused. The current government policy is the conservation of natural forests and sustainable use of timber plantations. In the past, leftover materials from the agricultural and forestry industries were usually burnt off as waste. Today, a variety of applications on multiple levels has been developed to maximize the value of secondary materials. These include turning the wood into fuel pellets, bio-charcoal, cat litter, fertilizer, and 3D printing materials. Industry-academic cooperation was also established through links to the private sector to solve the problem of transportation for secondary materials, promote reuse, boost positive benefits and enhance added value. Next, Ms. Yen Hsiu-hui spoke on \"Introduction of the Strategic Environmental Assessment system\". The presenter began by noting that policies may run into the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) during execution. The purpose of the law is to prevent and alleviate the environmental impact of development activities. The presenter also used the environmental impact assessments of Tamsui-Taipei Highway and Dunhua Financial Building as examples to illustrate the need for each project to undertake a holistic analysis on strategic feasibility. The presenter outlined what items and policy details should be assessed for environmental impact. She also stated that a strategic environmental assessment is relatively simple because it only asks the committee members for their opinions and does not go into the second phase of the environmental impact assessment. The standard environmental impact assessment process is more complex as it involves a written review, secondary environmental impact assessment, public explanatory meeting, preparation of an environmental impact assessment report, and public hearing. Strategic environmental assessments can help government agencies examine policies more closely to see if they will have a desirable effect on the future of the nation. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The May Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of May 25, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 17 ARF interns and their parents on a tour of Tianpu Community in Tainan to experience luffa gourd planting. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and provided the interns some general background knowledge. The morning's itinerary brought the group to Tianpu community in Yujing, Tainan, where the community's volunteer acted as tour guide. The tour began with an introduction to the environment surrounding the luffa farm and functions of its eco-pond. The tour guide then explained the growing process of the luffa gourds and how to differentiate between male and female flowers. Normally, male flowers will face the sun while the female flowers face downward and carry a small green luffa. Everyone was taught how to determine when the luffa gourds are ready for harvesting as the flesh inside the luffa gourds will become fibrous if left past the harvesting period. When growing luffa gourds, melon flies (Bactrocera cucurbitae) are the main pest. They will lay eggs under the fruit skin after the female flower has withered and the maggots that hatched will start eating from within the fruits. For pest control, luffa farmers will usually cover very young fruits with newspapers, and hang yellow sticky paper or PET bottles smeared with yellow adhesive to capture the flies. The interns were told to find young fruits that had not been infested by fly eggs, and bag them with recycled newspapers and steel wire ties. After the experience, the tour guide explained the effects of luffa water and the method of extracting luffa water. After all the luffa gourds have been harvested, and the plant is no longer watered and there is no rain seven days prior to the water extraction, the stem nearest the root is cut off in the evening and a large PET bottle is used to collect the liquid that flows out. Early next morning, the PET bottle is retrieved and the liquid is filtered several times to obtain the luffa water for daily use. After lunch, everyone learned to make luffa soap. The next destination after Tianpu community is Xiaochong Orchard, which specializes in the cultivation of Irwin mangoes. Orchard owner Li Yu-chung was the tour guide. Mr. Li began by explaining that Irwin mangoes were originally grown in Florida whereas the local mango was introduced into Taiwan from India during the time of Dutch rule. Belonging to the Anacardiaceae family, mangoes are not favored by bees and are mainly pollinated by blow flies (Calliphoridae). As mangoes are susceptible to oriental fruit flies (Bactrocera dorsalis), they must pass quarantine inspection, and steamed at 46.5 degrees Celsius to kill any insect larva, when exported to countries that have not been invaded by oriental fruit flies. Finally, Mr. Li said that the crops are easily influenced by weather and the fruits are prone to splitting this year because of the rainy weather. He added that lychee orchards in other places are also affected by the warm winter last year. Due to the unusually small quantity of blossoms, lychee harvest is not expected to be good this year. The impact of climate change on humanity is a pressing issue that deserves serious consideration.  At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The June Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on June 23, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Recently, the world has been in turmoil with the ongoing anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong and the U.S.-China trade war. Therefore, we should all now be watching these changes closely in their overall development and possessing a conservative attitude while planning for the worst scenarios. On the other hand, Archilife Research Foundation\u2019s Headquarter has received its User License. Our colleagues have been preparing for new approaches on Wormhole Bookish Assembly and Public Policy Communion to take place soon, so that members of Archilife will be empowered with more valuable knowledge. Our headquarter building has been named \"Chang\u2027An Building\" where \"Chang\" (Chang-An means longevity in Chinese) is pronounced with a long \"Chang\" sound to emphasize our wish for eternal peace and for our country to safely endure all crises. We\u2019ve chosen pink for the font color to symbolize gender equality. Last but not least, I would like to remind everyone that the World Sustainable Built Environment Conference or Beyond 2020 will take place in Sweden in June 2020. Please submit your papers by the end of July as we continue to convey our Archilife philosophy throughout the world.\" Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chou Yu-ching spoke on \"All About Food Allergy\". The speaker first pointed out that in the recent years, immune system disorders have risen to be the third most catastrophic illness as determined by the National Health Insurance. Dramatic changes in climate, environmental pollution and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits are all possible causes for the severity of these disorders. The speaker further explained that a food allergy occurs when the immune system shows abnormal immune-reaction to certain food. However, discomfort resulted from the consumption of specific kinds of food doesn\u2019t directly translate to food allergy \u2013 in some cases, the unpleasant physical reaction could actually be due to food intolerance. The speaker pointed out that one could take \"sources of food allergy testing\", make use of a rotation diet to avoid allergic foods, take appropriate dietary supplements and probiotics to protect digestive system environment and strengthen liver\u2019s detoxification capability. This way the body\u2019s self-healing capability will be naturally enhanced to prolong a healthy life. Next, Ms. Li Chun-ju spoke on \"Let\u2019s E-Learning \u2013 A Novel Travel and Learn around Taiwan\". The speaker first mentioned about the ongoing Environmental Education Facility and Venue Integration Promotion Project Work Plan, which Ms. Li hoped would find a new presentation platform for environmental education via an interesting teaching method and through cross-industry integration. Resource inventory and integration for environmental education venues are first conducted; itineraries that center on the spirit of green travel are planned out according to local characteristics. The speaker then shared with the audience the key current environmental issues that she has observed on ten of the travel routes throughout Taiwan. Ms. Li pointed out that, there are no absolute correct answers in the process of environmental education. As we make our decisions along the way, the costs we have paid forward and the results we have gained will lead us to more in-depth thoughts \u2013 if we observe some behaviors from a sustainable and long-term perspective, would all of us humans make different choices? Next, Ms. Chang Kuei-feng spoke on \"Brief Discussion of Strategic Plan for National Spatial Development in Rural Areas from the Perspective of Regional Revitalization\". The speaker explained that the 2010 Strategic Plan for National Spatial Development had mentioned that global climate change and impact on the economy were causing a sizeable shift in the course of national spatial development. As for today, the National Development Council has set forth the 2019 National Development Plan and the Executive Yuan has announced year 2019 as Taiwan\u2019sRegional Revitalization Year \u2013 in which industries fitted for local characteristics would be developed to attract population back to the rural areas and have the youngsters move back to their hometowns so that a \"balanced development in Taiwan\" could be achieved. Ms. Chang also mentioned that Ando Tadao has been \"planting trees and introducing wind,\" where the concept of green corridors incorporated with wind corridors is used to fight against the heat island effects. Finally, the speaker pointed out that the Strategic Plan for National Spatial Development is still currently undergoing revisions and she hoped that everyone would continue to monitor this topic closely. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The June Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of June 22, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 13 ARF interns and their parents to Shimen to discover the ecological environment at Alibang Ecological Farm and play in the creek. It was sunny on the day of tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Alibang Ecological Farm at Shimen, New Taipei City, was built from funds pooled together by 60 families. For years, it has maintained the principle of \"ecological restoration and low level of development\", keeping its landform and ecosystem intact, and developing high biodiversity. The farm boasts up to 19 frog species, making it a great place to observe frogs on summer nights. The tour started with an introduction to the origin of the farm and its diverse ecological environment by a retired teacher, Madam Wang Su-chen. She explained that Alibang is the old name of the area. It became an important place for fabric dyeing in the early days due to its bounteous production of Strobilanthes cusia. \"Alibang\" means \"dye workshop\" in the language of the Pepo tribe. Speaking on the initial objective for building the farm, Madam Wang encouraged the interns to get to know plants and animals through observation, listening and touch, and learn about caring for nature. She then took out the complete shed skin of a snake to allow the interns to get up close to it using the above methods, and established the basic concept of outdoor observation. During the guided tour on the ecological trail next, Madam Wang introduced the insects and plants seen along the way. Using picture cards, she taught everyone how to differentiate between dragonfly and damselfly, and the main differences between a butterfly and a moth. She also mentioned that, to differentiate between taro and giant taro in the wild, one can observe the state of water on their leaves. Water will form little droplets on the leaf of the taro plant but not on that of the giant taro. In the early days, butchers would wrap pieces of meat in giant taro leaves. It is safe as long as the juice of the leaves does not come into contact with the meat and the meat is washed well. In fact, it is more eco-friendly than the use of plastic packaging today. After lunch, which was classic home dishes made from local ingredients, everyone headed to Alibang Creek. Farm owner Mr. Wang Te-chang was the tour guide. On the way, he introduced the surrounding ecosystem and facts about the Alibang Creek. Due to the effect of the northeastern monsoon, rain is most intensive in winter and significantly less during the rest of the year, making it most suitable for fieldtrips in summer. Mr. Wang then reminded everyone about general precautions when playing in the creek, including the weather, rainfall two days before, speed of water flow and not littering. On arrival at the destination, the interns went into the water in search of bottom-dwelling organisms. The clean water provides excellent environment for the organisms to thrive. It is also a testimony of excellent land cover upstream and good ecological environment. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The July Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on July 14, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Under the impact of the drastic climate, frequent epidemics, food crises, and changes in the ecosystem have resulted. The current desertification phenomenon is the most severe in the PIIGS, leading to social unrest and economic turmoil. We hereby appeal to all to keep a close eye on changes in the external situation and our own actions. In addition, it has been twenty years since the Archilife Wormhole Bookish Assembly was established. Over time, the members of Archilife have accumulated knowledge needed to seize opportunities and gain insights into any situation demanding judgement. At present, Archilife Research Foundation is planning a new \"Bookish Assembly 2.0\" that adheres to the goal of deepening the values and continuing to lead all towards a complete knowledge of the field. Lastly, confronted by a harsh environment, please be reminded to take a conservative approach, with the connotation of \u2018seeking survival, ensuring livelihood, and prolonging life, thereby progressing one step at a time.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Gao Chuan-chi spoke on \"The Construction of Local Education and Local Studies\". The presenter first guided the participants to contemplate on two questions: Where will our children grow and thrive? Where will we return? He further pointed out the importance of our hometown, specifically local education. In addition to the government\u2019s systematic creation of exhibition hall software and hardware, the presenter also went outdoors to teach the children. On top of this, the intrinsic essence of creating a better tomorrow remains the primary task for front-line educators. The presenter also mentioned the recent joining of Dadaocheng Local Creation Co., Ltd., hoping that people from all walks of life can strive to contribute to making the streets more interesting and vigorous, promoting more industrial development, and carrying on historical significance. Next, Mr. Li Shu-an spoke on \"PM2.5 Component Analysis and the Impact on the Climate\". The presenter first introduced the air quality monitoring network of the Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan intended to give the general public access to relevant information. He then mentioned that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) declared that outdoor air pollution is a group 1 carcinogen, and Taiwan added PM2.5 air quality standards in 2012. Although the concentration of PM2.5 has an effect on visibility, the air humidity also changes. However, air quality is also subject to the influence of the weather and terrain. From October to March the following year is the season of air pollution prevalence in Taiwan. According to the data analysis of the Central Weather Bureau, the wind velocity is showing a trend of a yearly increase, but the stratosphere shows an obvious increase of temperature and the troposphere has a temperature inversion structure, indicating a more stable atmosphere and increasing difficulty discharging pollutants, resulting in a cumulative state. Next, Mr. Sun Ta-lun spoke on \"Gender Equality and Other Important Issues and Introduced the Gender Equality Promotion Plans of the Ministries Under the Executive Yuan\". The presenter first mentioned the strategic direction of the gender equality related issues passed by the Executive Yuan in 2017, with five important gender equality related issues as the promotion focus and implemented beginning 2019, namely, \"promoting the three-in-one policy of public childcare\", \"enhancing female economic power\", \"eradicating gender stereotypes and prejudice\", \"strengthening public support for the aging society\", and \"promoting gender equality with the participation of the public sector and the private sector\" . The presenter said that the promotion of gender equality will rely on the cooperation of respective ministries, thus gathering feasible and efficient practices for implementation in governmental policy administration. We encourage everyone to work together to achieve the national goal of moving toward substantial gender equality. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The July Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\n", "For the study tour of July 27, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 26 ARF interns and their parents to Golden Town in Miaoli to learn about irrigation canals and red jujube cultivation. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Focusing on Golden Town in Miaoli, the study tour began with DIY beeswax wraps in the morning. Before the DIY activity starts, the tour guide explained that beeswax is wax secreted by worker bees and it is used to construct combs of their hive. Secreting one portion of beeswax requires the ingestion of eight portions of honey, thus natural beeswax is precious. Beeswax has extensive applications, including use as lip balm and in skincare products. In ancient times, candles used by wealthy families contained beeswax. Beeswax is mainly harvested from burr combs built by bees in unwanted places during spring-summer reproduction period and from old combs. The tour guide warned that some farmers use paraffin wax to build the foundation for the beehives due to cost consideration. If the old combs from such beehives are sold after they are melted, the beeswax mixed with paraffin wax will not be suitable for use in food products. Thus, one should be careful when purchasing beeswax wrap. During the DIY activity, the tour guide explained the use of beeswax wrap and how to wash it. Due to the beeswax's low melting point, the beeswax wrap cannot be used to wrap hot food otherwise the beeswax on the cotton fabric will melt. At the red jujube orchard, the tour guide provided instruction before everyone started plucking the fruits. The interns thought it was an interestingly new experience as it was the first time they saw fresh red jujubes. After lunch, everyone visited Miaoli Cultural Park. Besides the showcase of local agricultural products, the park also provides an overview of the ceramics industry in Miaoli. During the Japanese Occupation, the the Shinchiku-Taichu earthquake unearthed refined soil, and with the discovery of petroleum, natural gas and coal, the ceramics industry began to boom with the abundance of natural resources. At the next destination, Chuan Long Education Farm, the tour guide introduced, with the use of slides, the origin of the name \"Golden Town\", its industrial development, surrounding environment and the community's promotion of agricultural tourism. The tour guide also explained that Gongguan, Miaoli, is the only red jujube production area in Taiwan as its unique geographical environment is ideal for the growth of red jujube, providing mineral-rich irrigation water, well-drained soil, and cold wind blowing along Houlong River from Xueshan Range reduces the infestation of fruit flies. After the slide presentation, everyone made their way to Chuan-long Canal on foot. Along the way, the tour guide explained the construction of the canal and its importance to the local residents. The pristine water drawn from Houlong Creek is the key reason why Gongguan is suitable for growing crops, and is essentially the river of life of the locality. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The August Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on August 25, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"The most devastating forest fire in recent years took place in the Amazon rain forest, burning for about three weeks. It is apparent that with the constantly changing external environment, we should be alert at all times, pay attention to our own safety and act according to our own ability. Additionally, Archilife Research Foundation will officially relocate to \"Chang\u2027An Building\" on September 3rd. In addition to planning a new form of Bookish Assembly and gathering, it will hand over to the new generation within three years to lead Arhcilife to continue moving forward. The new form of \"Bookish Assembly 2.0\" will be officially held on September 10th. On the site, participants can express their comments, hoping to promote more exchanges, moving towards the goal from specialization, general knowledge, to collective wisdom. In order to lead everyone to continue to focus on the effects of climate change on the living environment, the \"Archilife Riddle Guess\" will continue to be carried out. With \"What will this winter appear to be?\" as the theme, four choices are provided: \"1. Warm winter; 2. Days wear on like years; 3. There is no winter at all; 4. None of the above\". Everyone is requested to show concern towards the issue of climate change.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Lin Yu-yi spoke on \"Kaohsiung City\u2019s National Land Planning Promotion\". The presenter first said that the national land planning will be divided by function, including national land conservation areas, marine areas, agricultural development areas, and urban and rural development areas. The objective of the legislation is to ensure national land security in response to climate change, conserve the natural environment and cultural assets, and promote the reasonable distribution of resources and industries, thereby strengthening the national land integration and management mechanism. The presenter then elaborated on Kaohsiung City\u2019s national land planning overall spatial development concept of \"one core, two hearts, three axes, four regions.\" The conduction focus lies in maintaining the total output of agricultural lands, handling of major infrastructure planning areas, the disposal of unregistered factories, indigenous village and rural area planning, and national land function zoning. At present, many public hearing sessions have been held to establish public participation and compensation mechanisms. Next, Mr. Chang Chen-chung spoke on \"The Concept of Cultural Asset Value Prioritization\". The presenter first said that Taiwan officially implemented the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act on May 26, 1982 and substantively revised the content of the said act on July 12, 2016, adding incentives as well as substantially increasing penalties. The presenter went on to explain the value prioritization referred to a basic consensus reached by countries around the world regarding cultural asset preservation goals. In order to facilitate cultural asset reutilization, building management, land use, and fire safety-related matters are not bound by existing regulatory limitations. Ongoing construction projects or other development practices, including monuments, historical buildings, and so on should be terminated at once. The presenter also cited Taiwan Power Company\u2019s Jinguashi Highlights Plan, the Sandiaoling-Mudan Tunnel Regeneration, the Banqiao Diyi Shrine Project, etc. as examples to give participants better insights. Next, Mr. Yao Wei-cheng spoke on \"Genetic Technology and Health Knowledge Improvement\". The presenter first mentioned health knowledge refers to an individual\u2019s ability to interact with health information, able to engage in critical analysis and use information, extract information from various communication channels to understand the significance and possess adequate reading and writing skills. The presenter then mentioned how foreign scholars said genetic technology is the key to fight against climate change. Chimpanzees have an additional pair of chromosomes compared to humans, but does it mean they are more outstanding than humans? Genetic engineering helps create super organisms, but whether or not this practice leads to hope or destruction remains to be seen. Finally, we hope that the general public can better understand the progress of genetic technology to have an opportunity to improve human wellbeing rather than abusing it. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The August Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of August 31, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 22 ARF interns and their parents to Sanxia to experience river tracing and wood crafting. It was clear and sunny on the day of the tour, and the interns and their parents were on time for the departure. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. Centering on Youmu Elementary School, the study tour began with river tracing in the morning. After listening to the safety precautions and key points when gearing up for river tracing, everyone walked to Zhongkeng River, which is one of the three tributaries upstream of Dabao River. Located near Manyueyuan National Forest Recreation Area, the surrounding ecological environment is fully preserved with rich diversity of low-altitude plants and aquatic insects. With relatively even elevation, the route is for beginners and suitable for the general public. The coach reminded all to make sure that everyone was in the right condition to go into the water. Furthermore, when moving in the water, everyone should move at his/her own pace steadily and avoid trying to catch up with those who were faster. As river tracing involves moving against the current, everyone must work together to reach the destination and give each other a hand whenever necessary. After some warm-up exercise, everyone slowly entered the river, and began the river tracing experience after the initial adjustment to the water temperature by washing face and splashing water. During the tracing process, everyone learned to trust their partners and take up challenges through activities, such as flowing along with the current, river jumping and floating while holding hands with others in a circle. The interns appeared to feel accomplished after having successfully completed their challenges. After lunch, Mr. Wu Ching-yi, head of the teaching division of Youmu Elementary School, introduced the school's special courses through projection slides, including rock climbing, river tracing, ropes course and firefly observation at night during school camps. With the objective of deepening knowledge through ecological discovery, the school aims to nurture students differently from the traditional way of learning from books. Students are trained to build courage and the ability to solve problems, develop interpersonal relationships and cooperation with others, and achieve the sense of accomplishment. During the DIY wood crafting session, the interns learned to make wooden spoons and forks. Youmu village used to be where the nation's best quality Taiwan incense cedar was found but few people know about this part of their history now. Thus, Youmu Elementary School has started a series of wood crafting courses to allow people to learn more about the local characteristics. The DIY session began with the interns choosing the style of wooden handle they liked. The interns then used sand paper to polish its surface and rotate the stainless steel utensil into the handle, and complete their unique work by filling the gap in the slot with thin toothpicks and painting over with white glue and varnish. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The September Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2019 was held on September 22, 2019. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Archilife was officially relocated to \"Chang\u2027An Building\" on September 3rd, hoping that the new site may help establish a higher order and enhance efficiency. Additionally, due to constant changes in the external environment, such as the disaster-grade haze in Indonesia blowing with the monsoon that impacts neighboring Southeast Asian countries. Taiwan, in the face of ecological changes, has been subject to shallot price hikes. Moreover, with the ongoing Sino-US trade war, the so-called last four cavaliers have arrived. For Taiwan, the August 17th communique proviso ensures Taiwan\u2019s defense capabilities that match up those of China and enables Taiwan to achieve balance in an unstable situation. For those who are present here today, let us work together, take our path, and withstand the harsh environment.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Cheng Wei-ning, presented a speech on the \"2019 Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report\". The presenter first said that the focus in the present stage lies in Archilife Sub-Shield Center\u2019s hygiene and health plans, epidemic development forecast, and proper countermeasure responses. First, based on the abnormal climate trend analysis, the long-term high temperature and drought trend have been validated, which will impact public health in Taiwan. Therefore, a prewarning system should be set up to reduce risks. In terms of personal hygiene and education training, the regional climatic environment and ecological conditions should be properly monitored in order to strengthen stationing personnel\u2019s physical health and psychological status. Additionally, special attention should be given to environmental hygiene management and infectious disease control, efficient medical system support setup, personnel rescue skill training, and the selection of garments made of suitable materials, and the improvement of the Energy Food Supply Operation Manual. In the future, changes in various factors will continue to be observed to conduct more in-depth relevant research. Next, Ms. Sun Ruei-suei spoke on \"Local Creation and Art Festival: Focused on Land Art Season\". The presenter first said the rise of cultural tourism contributed to local transformation and development. Take Japan for instance; its \u201clocal creation\u201d policy is a \u201cnational\u201d plan whose focus lies in: 1. Seeking and directing global capital investment in infrastructure through Tokyo Olympic Games; 2. Upgrading the local communities for future cultural tourism; 3. Preparing for social welfare with fund shortages. In the era of globalization, locality creation involves interaction and association with mass tourism to form cultural interaction and reproduction, and design the localities to be recognized by the world and for future generations to recall who they are. Hence, the vision and aesthetics of locality creation are issues of great importance. Finally, the presenter said the local creation capabilities to be upgraded include: planning, curation, and design. It is expected that Taiwan\u2019s true strength in aesthetics, culture, and art imagination can be brought into full play through local transformation. Next, Mr. Tsai Kun-hsien spoke on \"Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and Global Vector Control Strategies\". The presenter first mentioned the SDGs comprise 17 items, and members can work on the items based on their field of expertise. The presenter mainly conducted research on insect-borne diseases, including not only malaria and dengue fever but also flee control. Vector control requires inter-ministerial cooperation at home and abroad, community health education participation promotion, vector monitoring, intervention, and control, and integration and optimization of national strategies. The presenter further said that one can only understand by doing. Therefore, he led students to engage in internship in Africa, hoping that the students could learn to value university social responsibility. Over the past half a year, beach flea control was carried out in Kenya, Africa, sequentially setting up beach flea epidemic prevention systems, organic farms, and clean drinking water systems on campuses, thereby helping the locals improve the situation of infectious disease invasion. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The September Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "For the study tour of September 21, 2019, Ms. Lu Ming-yun led 12 ARF interns and their parents to Taoyuan to learn about gemstones and disaster prevention. At the start of the day's activities, team leader Ms. Lu Ming-yun reminded everyone about things to note and what to observe, and gave the interns some background knowledge. The day's itineraries began with a visit to Te-Hsin Hall in the morning. Guided by the local development association's volunteer, the tour began with an introduction of the building's geographical position. Seated in the east and facing west, the building's position is designed according to Fengshui principle to gather wealth. In ancient times, birds were thought to be creatures of the spiritual realm and could communicate with gods. Thus, swallow-tail ridge were often seen in the architectural designs of temples and residences of government officials. As the traditional Minnan-style house features a swallow-tail ridge, it is evident that the owner's ancestor was once a government official. Next destination on the itineraries was Jurassic Museum. The tour guide began by explaining environmental conditions required for the formation of gems, and the characteristics and places of origin of different types of gemstones. Red spinel and red corundum are similar in appearance and are often mistaken. For instance, the Black Prince's ruby on the state crown of England was later proven to be a red spinel. Everyone then watched a documentary on gemstone mining, which showed miners having to go down the mine which was as deep as the height of Taipei 101. The inside of the mines are dusty and work environment is harsh, and tunnels can collapse easily during explosions. Thus, miners working underground often do not live past 35 years old, giving cause for us to reflect on the issue of the divide between the rich and the poor. After watching the documentary, the tour guide taught everyone an easy method to identify real amber \u2013 genuine amber will float in a saturated saline solution because of its relatively low density. After lunch, everyone headed to Taoyuan Disaster Education Center. Using interactive models, the tour guide explained the reasons natural disasters, such as typhoon, earthquake and mudslide, occur. According to the tour guide, the transmission of seismic waves causes us to feel vibration when earthquake occurs. There are mainly two types of seismic waves, the less destructive P wave and more destructive S wave. Today's earthquake early warning system uses the initial P wave to predict the vibration of the oncoming S wave and sends out alert before the S wave arrives, providing critical seconds of notice. In the fire prevention zone of the center, everyone learned that there are four types of fire which must be extinguished differently to avoid causing greater danger. Everyone also participated in an evacuation drill in a smoky room. As the day of the visit marked the 20th anniversary of the 921 earthquake, the tour guide reminded everyone to remember the three steps to take during an earthquake, i.e. drop, cover and hold on. After finding a suitable shelter, one should cover one's head and neck with both arms. Everyone also practiced the three steps on an earthquake experience platform, which could become handy in the event of an actual earthquake. At this point, the day's itinerary came to an end. Everyone took a group photo before heading back and looked forward to the next study tour.\r\n", "The January Archilife Public Policy Communion of 2020 was held on January 19, 2020. After a series of relaxing and fun activities, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"Climate change has constantly caused disasters around the world. Given the situation, Achilife members are reminded to be clear about their central idea, refrain from repeating what others say and give constructive suggestions for the country and society. After three years of silence, the third stage-2 Pioneer Special Team meeting was held on October 26th, 2019 and the Pioneer Special Team will move towards the \"2.0\" version, establish life-related \"Pioneer indicators\", and predict future trends, which will be conducive to the establishment of a code of conduct. In addition, the re-engraved version of \"Justice and Mercy\" published 17 years ago will be released. The 26 persons interviewed also include President Tsai Ing-wen and myself. In the future, all of you present today may become somebody in the society. Therefore, we should be cautious with our manners and grasp the principle of doing things.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Mr. Chou Po-cheng gave a presentation on \"International Sustainability and Health Indicators and Other Policy Benchmarking\". First, the speaker explained the profound influence of Staatliches Bauhaus on modern architecture. The presenter went on about Japan\u2019s NEXT21 experimental housing that provides a lifestyle in harmony with nature, uses plants to change the microclimate and temperature of the base in response to the urban heat island effect. Targeting the 17 SDGs proposed by the United Nations, we also attempted to benchmark ongoing businesses. The presenter said the  promotion of the design criteria of the \"Kaohsiung Housing Plan\" corresponded to the UN\u2019s SDGs, effectively planning and establishing sustainable living environment transformation in Kaohsiung. The presenter also cited cases of landscape balconies that effectively reduce the home indoor temperature and have the advantages of beautifying the living environment and improving the quality of life. Next, Mr. Tai Yung-ti, spoke on \"Indigenous Community in Universities\". First, the speaker said that the role of the university has changed. Faced with a new civilization in the future, universities should foster talents capable of coping with complex changes. The presenter believes that the indigenous culture is key to the new civilization. He went on about the Chung Yuan Christian University\u2019s commencement of Bachelor Program in Design for Indigenous Students. The courses include indigenous culture and social design, media art and contextual space and symbiotic environment. Tribal teaching was also conducted. By developing habits and practicing repeatedly, the body naturally memorized. The courses adopted co-teaching support and mixed-level teaching. The presenter also led the students into the tribe, hoping that the students could have the opportunity to return to the tribe upon graduation. Indigenous students are relatively economically disadvantaged. Hence, in addition to imparting knowledge, the school has also formulated guidelines to take care of students in daily life, giving emphasis to recruiting students with the \"willingness to learn,\" \"consideration for others\" and \"teamwork spirit\". Next, Ms. Yeh Jiuan-reng, spoke on \"Insights into Folk Music and Culture Leading to National Prosperity\". First, the speaker said \"culture leading to national prosperity\" should be directed towards the positive force that enriches the value and connotation of people\u2019s daily lives, building a circular society, economy and environment. In the forward-looking infrastructure plan, Taiwan\u2019s music yearbook editing plan is an important research basis, because the yearbook is an annual and systematic collection of continuously published informational and literature books, with relatively complete information and authoritative and time-based contents. The plan survey records year-round music events in Taiwan. The observation aspects include exhibition events, ceremonial events, promotion education, traditional customary events, international and cross-strait exchanges, research and publication and cultural policies. The presenter also played live relevant exhibition music that with the melodious or majestic music, the participants felt as if they were personally on the scene. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation, and played a brainstorm game. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour. The January Archilife Public Policy Communion ended smoothly.\r\n", "The Archilife Research Foundation held the April Public Policy Communion on April 26, 2020. In order to defend against COVID-19 epidemic, the Wormhole on the 3rd floor of \"Chang-An Tower\" was used as the main venue for Archilife members to participate on-site. In addition, through the online virtual conference room and online live broadcast of activities, the Archilife members were provided with a digitalized mode of participation. Additionally, in consideration to the risk of the speaker\u2019s remote commuting, one of the speakers Mr. Wang Min-Chou reported through video connections. Secretary General Huang Chin-ying made the following announcement, \"In response to the impact of the epidemic, digitalized meetings were added to echo Archilife\u2019s concept of digital symbiosis as the new direction of civilization. At the Chang-An Tower, Archilife\u2019s advanced digital deployment contributed to the successful holding of the meeting where important issues were discussed with everyone. On top of it all, in view of the past SARS experience, Taiwan has achieved outstanding performance in the global epidemic prevention work. Also, since the Central Epidemic Command Center established order since the beginning and continued to correct and improve matters, eventually leading to the duplication of the successful experience. Therefore, Archilife members are requested to continue to accumulate knowledge and keep abreast of Archilife\u2019s beliefs : \"Order, Progress, Replication\" in order to become a role model for all lines of work. Finally, she reminded everyone to be ready for the long-term battle in the face of the harsh test from the four knights of doomsday. It is especially necessary to act cautiously nad conservatively, observe the surrounding changes and act accordingly.\"  Next on the schedule was the keynote speech. First, Ms. Cheng Wei-ning, presented a speech on the \"Archilife Living Special Team Meeting Implementation Report for the Second Half of 2019\". The speaker first said that the global climate change has shown the trend of turbulence, and the resulting hygiene and health issues have caused serious threats to the world. The recent spread of COVID-19 has further caused social unrest. In this stage, the climate trend changes are under observation, with Archilife Sub-Shield Center as the base in preparation for vertical migrations. On the issues discussed, first, the extreme weather and disease coping strategies were explored, prioritizing the establishment of a pre-warning system and the creation of environmental management and disease prevention operating manuals. Secondly, the verification migration plans, wild vegetable planting plans, wilderness camp and summer camp training, and community symbiosis strategies in response to climate change were discussed. After formulating the coping plans above, specific actions were subsequently taken. In addition to strengthening the Archilife Sub-Shield Center ability to cope with climate change and the conditions as an evacuation base or a second office, the preparations for future vertical migration are also underway. Next, Mr. Wang Min-Chou spoke on \"Winner of the Sustainability Awards\". The speaker first mentioned that he received the Sustainability awards in 2009 for the theme \"Blue Ocean Strategy of Kenting National Park Sustainability Development-Promotion partnerships through Ecotourism\". In addition to keeping in line with the management trends of the contemporary protection zones, the concept of biodiversity conservation has been successfully marketed. Under the leadership of President Lin Chun-Hsing the same year, training targeting environmental ethics and sustainable development issues has also been conducted. The speaker also introduced the 2019 \"National Sustainability Development Awards\" recipients (units) and used the Chuang Foo Foundation, Northeast and Yilan Coast National Science Area Administration, and the National Health Insurance Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare as examples to introduce sustainable development related work provided by the units. Although the unrecognized Dadushan National Face Mask Team offered tremendous help during the epidemic, since the factories on the agricultural land are mostly illegal, they have not been awarded. Lastly, the speaker mentioned the \"human-centered health and sustainable earth\" viewpoint: Sustainability can only continue to be promoted through health. He also called on everyone to continue to accumulate knowledge to assist in Taiwan\u2019s sustainable development and enable Taiwan to further assist in sustainable development globally. After the speech, Secretary General Huang Chin-ying presented a gift to the speakers on behalf of the foundation. Then, attendees expressed and exchanged their opinions and views during the piggy hour.
